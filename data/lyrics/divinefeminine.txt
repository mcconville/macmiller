Skin

[Intro]
*Woman panting*

[Verse 1]
You hide your skin like ya shy or did somethin' wrong
You stylish when you got nothin' on, yeah
And all I do is make these fuckin' songs
So, finally, I made a fuckin' song
And now she comin' closer
Hope she crawls, she wanna jump my bones
You want it, don't ya?
I was a soldier, now I'm comin' home, the war is over
Kick down the door, I hold your bends, you never break
You need to smell your sweet aroma
See, I knows you smell like cinnamon, kissin' your lips
I lick my fingertips and get your clitoris in the mix
My dick on business trips
My tongue twistin' is ticklin' just a little bit
I'm swimmin' inside of your skin like a river
In the Caribbean

[Bridge]
It's okay that you like it, babe (I like it, baby)
And it's alright that you misbehave
It's okay to be this way (This way)
To live this way, baby, baby (Ooh, baby)
Chillin' with the AC

[Chorus]
(The way we are) That's just the way that we are
You and me, super freaks, here we are
(The way we are) I'm takin' care of each and every part
I open up your legs and go straight for your heart
The way we are, the way we are

[Verse 2]
Said I'm too divine, I'm too divine, yeah; too divine
Who am I? Well; I'm Mr. Superfly
I'm Mr. Ooh-He-Blew-Your-Mind, hot as June, July
I wanna make your waterfall
Girl, you my paintin', you my art installation
Gonna fuck you, put you on the wall
All I wanna do is show you off, I want to put you on
Why would I ever blow you off?
Right now, let's go get lost
Jet, I've been way too high for way too long
I'm so exhausted
Whether that's your mind or line, we still get crossed
First your name is gone
Never understand until you have to stand alone
Can I have a hand to hold?
A Band-Aid for my damaged soul, I paint the planet gold
I swear I'm Michelangelo, I don't understand these hoes
They didn't want a man when it was, "Man, I'm broke"
And now they know me and what I don't need
You gon' see it's gon' be what it's gon' be

[Chorus]
(The way we are) That's just the way that we are
You and me, super freaks, here we are
(The way we are) I'm takin' care of each and every part
I open up your legs and go straight for your heart
The way we are, the way we are

[Outro]
These hoes
These hoes
Taste this, taste, taste this
These hoes
Taste this, taste, taste this
These hoes


God is Fair, Sexy Nasty

[Intro: Mac Miller]
La, la, la, la, la (Oh play that shit boy)
La, la, la, la (Yeah)
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la (Don't be afraid, baby)
La, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la
Open your legs

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Say yeah
Share
Say yeah
Share
Say yeah

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Delusional Thomas]
Hearts on my timeline
Bullet to your rose, then I watch your petal fold
Don't you know your body been mine?
I know you know I know
Sexy, nasty
Have no guideline
One day, four times
You don't mind that
I don't care (Pleasure)
Your divinity has turned me into a sinner
God is fair (Pleasure)
And your beauty can even make hell have a winter

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah
And a freak mind is divine, so we fuck from behind
On these sides, between thighs I eat up
Why do I do anything but trust myself?
Tried to give her up but she fuck so well
Man, that bitch so cold, man, that bitch so cold
I'ma take my time, I'ma hit that slow
'Cause I ain't in a rush young girl
You the only thing for me in this fucked up world
And do you believe in love?
Hold on tight when demons come
It'll be alright, no need to run
Stay with me tonight, we'll see the sun
And when we wake up early we'll still be young
Never felt this free before, I need you more
Than keys need doors, I need you sleepin' next to me
The blanket sheets, I'll take them all and keep you warm (Yeah)
And I teach her that we were the creatures of love
You be the leader, I could be Julius Caesar
When I'm pullin' up in the Bimmer
The beats in the trunk, all the freaks wanna fuck

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Hearts on my timeline
Bullet to your rose, then I watch your petal fold
Don't you know your body been mine?
I know you know I know
Sexy, nasty (Sexy, nasty)
Have no guideline (Have no guideline)
One day, four times
You don't mind that
I don't care (Pleasure)
God is fair (Pleasure)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I need to feel your touch
You shy, you don't reveal too much
No lies, don't hide yourself at all
With you, I just can't help but fall
It's true, and I'll try everything
Girl you my sexy nasty, thing
She been getting faded all the time, flap your wings
I been getting stoned all week
It make me go too deep
Girl, you so lonely
Will you come home with me?
Just take your clothes off, babe
Know that we been talkin' on the phone all day
I love it when you tell me that you don't behave
Tell me when and where, I bet I won't be late
All I really wanna do is procreate
I'm a Superman, you'll be my Lois Lane
Know you late for work, you stayin' home today
We gon' keep on goin' 'til our bones both break
It's the grown folk way, yeah

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Hearts on my timeline
Bullet to your rose, then I watch your petal fold
Don't you know your body been mine?
I know you know I know
Sexy, nasty (Sexy, nasty)
Have no guideline (Have no guideline)
One day, four times
You don't mind that
I don't care (Pleasure)
God is fair (Pleasure)

[Piano Interlude: Robert Glasper]

[Outro]
Hello, I would like to tell you about my love affair with my husband and the wonderful ways that we were able to understand each other, and find out about each other. We got to know each other little by little, living very close in the same building, and he would help me with things, and I would see him and think "what a cute guy," and he was a cute guy. And it was just little by little, we got to know just to say hello. One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him, people respected him, and he was good to everybody, he knew, people he worked with all adored him. And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody, for me was the most important. Being attracted to him and being... finding people respected him and I respected him. I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time...

So, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other and the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys. And...my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys, and I feel I just gave him a wonderful life. A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too. And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other.

Yeah, hold up
Wait a motherfuckin' second (Wait a second), I know you stressin'
You don't gotta keep me guessin' (Keep me guessin'), I'm full of questions
In return I get the silent treatment (Ssh), I don't know why I'm speakin'
You say, you say, you say it's way too late, goodbye, you leavin'
Why you got me stressin'? (Oh my God)
I could have a whole collection, just be faded in my own dimension
You so complicated, I swear that pussy Grammy nominated

Okay now, baby, don't you leave my side, don't even try
I'ma go crazy, girl, you save me, meditate me, give me peace of mind
It's only she and I, ocean floor, how deep we dive
We be high, lookin' for another fuckin' tree to climb
She was playin' hard to get, I read between the lines
Binge watched Sopranos, made it all the way to season five
I am her, she is I
She had to come to see her freaky side, leavin' me behind

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Will you
Stay just a little while
Babe? Just a little while
Just a little while, just a little while

The Divine Feminine, an album by Mac Miller
Ohhhhh-ohhh
(The Divine Feminine, hehehe)
(The Divine Feminine, hehehe)
Ohhhhh (Hehe)

[Interlude: Mac Miller]
Am I supposed to? Okay... love
Love, love, love, love, love (Sex)
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love (Sex)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
This sun don't shine when I'm alone
I lose my mind and I lose control
I see your eyes look through my soul
Don't be surprised, this all I know
I felt the highs and they feel like you
See a love like mine is too good to be true
And you too divine to just be mine
You remind me of the color blue
Girl, I'm so in love with you, yeah
Girl, I'm so in love with you

[Bridge 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (Baby), yeah, yeah
Um, well

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Baby, you were everything I ever wanted
Bought a wedding ring, it's in my pocket
Planned to ask the other day
Knew you'd run away, so I guess I just forgot it
Remember when you went away to college?
Hours on the phone, we end up talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip, God damn
Puppy love ain't what it was, darlin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
I can make you laugh, I can break the glass
If we made it last, it'd be a bargain
Mr. Charmin', that is my department
You was there before the fancy cars and
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said, "All you ever think about is sex"
I'm like, "Oh well, you know me so well
And if this what make you late, I swear, I won't tell
And every time I call your phone, you better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail"
Well, I'm the jealous type
But I swear that ass is what Heaven's like
And when I'm in that pussy, it's a better life
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
It's my only chance, I better get it right

[Bridge 2: Mac Miller]
Take your time, my baby
It's all waitin' for you, for you
I know I make your mind go crazy
But it's all waitin' right here for you, for you

[Outro: Bilal]
You get closer with, run away
All I ever known is the color gray
Your lovely ways bring me sunshine
I found an angel so divine
Heaven probably not the same without you
But now you're in my world, in my world
Ahhhh, ahhhh
Ahhhh, ahhhh

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah, well, you could be my...
Said you could be my...

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Well, you ain't in the mood to argue
Baby, don't you worry, this some shit to get along to
Some shit I right my wrongs to
Well, I've tried to call you, have us a discussion
We never talk, we always way too busy fuckin'
I'll think of somethin' to say, I always do
I'm in love with the way that you say my name
Every time it sound brand new

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
And you, always wonderin' what we'll be
I say we sound better than you or me

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Baby, you could be my... (Woo)
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay

Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
Only if you be my...
It's alright, it's okay

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, okay, and time will tell
If I'm alive and well, 'cause when I'm by myself
I find that I keep flyin' high, sometimes I must remind myself
That change is more than pennies layin' on the floor inside the well
You cross my mind, do not apologize for bein' fine as hell
I'm spinnin' here inside your spell, my mind has start to wander
Miss a day, I stay up late admirin' your posture

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
And you, always wonderin' what we'll be
I say we sound better than you or me

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Baby, you could be my...
Yeah, okay, it's alright, it's okay
And, baby, you could be my...
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
And I can be your...
Okay, it's alright, it's okay
Yeah, only if you be my...

[Bridge: Cee-Lo Green]
There's no more you or me, we are we, yes we are (Yes we are, sweet baby)
And I can see, I can see, so much better (I can see)
And carefully, precious things fall apart
Just let them be, let it be, forever, oh
Lovin' me, in spite of me, bless your heart (Bless your heart)
I can breathe, I can breathe, so much better (Yeah)
I won't let anything tear us apart, no, no, no
We are we, we are we, forever

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
You could be my...
Okay, it's alright, it's okay
I feel like you could be my...
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
And I can be your...
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
Only if you be my...
It's alright, it's okay

[Outro: Cee-Lo Green]
You gotta deal with Mac Miller, bitch
Hehehehahah


My Favorite Part

[Intro: Ariana Grande]
I don't know why, but I think that he makes me smile

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And, baby, that's my favorite part
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright, babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love

[Verse: Mac Miller]
Said, you know I know who you really are, ain't need to lie
Said, the universe couldn't keep us apart
Why would it even try?
Yeah, said, don't let them hurt you ever
I know you far too smart
Before things come together, they have to fall apart
It's been a while since I've been sober
This life can be so hard, I'd rather talk about you

[Chorus: Mac Miller, Ariana Grande, Together]
Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And, baby, that's my favorite part (Oh)
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright, babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
If you wanna stay, we're taking it slow, baby
'Cause you want me, and I got enough on my mind
But I can make some time for something so divine, oh, yeah

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Ariana Grande]
Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And, baby, that's my favorite part
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright, babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love


Soulmate

[Intro]
You feel like you're alone, Will? You have a soulmate? Somebody who challenges you. I'm talking about someone who opens up things for you—touches your soul. You can't give back to them, you know. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're always afraid to take the first step because all you see is every negative thing 10 miles down the road. But you can do anything you want, you are bound by nothing...

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, are you my soulmate?
My angel, what do you want with me?
Too high (Too high), slow pace (Slow pace)
My eyes closed, your body all I see
I think you're too divine for my human mind
When I'm with you, what do you do? Bring me to life
No matter what, one day everyone dies (Oh, oh, oh, whoa-oh)
You think you a God 'til you run out of time (Oh, oh, oh, whoa-oh)
Yeah, said, when you're gone (Gone), what will you leave behind?
Yeah, do I belong sometime soon? Where goes my mind? (Oh, oh, oh, whoa-oh)

[Chorus: Mac Miller, Mac Miller & Unknown Woman]
You the one to show me
Divine love (Love), love (Love), love (Love), love
Where was you when I was lonely
My divine love (Love), love (Love), love (Love), love?
When the stereo plays our song, sounds so clear
Baby, where'd you go? What's so wrong?
I'm right here...

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, why do you stay on my case?
I try to make you feel okay
Do you know (Do you know,) I'm in pain?
I give you clues, you misconstrued
You continue to push me far away
Why don't you come on in?
It's like you forgot my face
I just wanna taste of everything you made of
We ain't (Nothing)
Cut the strings, my balloon, watch me fly
Yeah, said, when are you comin' through to free my mind?
Are you happy with your life?
Can I come and satisfy? Open up, let me inside
When you take off all your clothes, I am under your control
Rollin' up, you get me high (Oh, oh, oh, whoa-oh) (Alright)

[Chorus: Mac Miller, Mac Miller & Unknown Woman]
You the one to show me
Divine love, love, love, love
Where was you when I was lonely
My divine love, love, love, love?
When the stereo plays our song, sounds so clear
Baby, where'd you go? What's so wrong?
I'm right here...

We went straight into the room and played the music
Started dancin', you was takin' off your pants
It look like Dorothy ain't in Kansas anymore, I do you like a chore
We started on the bed and then we movin' to the floor
You started gettin' crazy, told me fuck you like a whore
I thought you was an angel, now you yellin' to the Lord
You used to tell me all the time I ain't ya type
Now you always wanna spend the night
Now I'm doin' everything you like
When I'm inside your pussy, damn, it feels so right (Yeah)
But I still respect ya game, every time I'm out-of-line
You always set me straight, the sex is great, for Heaven's sakes

You don't wanna grow up, yeah, that shit no fun

Yeah, the dick ain't free, I don't give no fucks
Yeah, it's complicated, got you frustrated
Get home late and you don't trust me, baby
Way too drunk, you don't know what I'm sayin'
You can drive my car, don't drive me crazy
Complicated, got you frustrated
Every single night I keep you waitin'
You say you don't care, that's what you sayin'?
We both know that's some bullshit
Okay, we be fightin', we be reunitin'
Kiss me, touch me, tease me, me excited
God, the devil, who is who?
Tryna get through to you because...

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I can't keep on
Losin' you over complications
Gone too soon, wait!
We was just hangin'
I can't seem to hold onto
Dang
The people that know me best
The key that I won't forget, too soon
I can't keep on losin' you

[Post-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Well
You can't go away, girl, I'ma need you
Play your games like they my ticket to an Ivy League school
Won't get Hall of Fame dick from a minor league dude
I just eat pussy, other people need food (Hahaha)
Only got a little time and I ain't tryna spend it
Arguin' about who ain't givin' who attention
Startin' up the engine, need to reboot
I just eat pussy, other people need food
And I use every bone in my body
Keep on holdin' on to your trust
I know you don't want nuttin' to do with me
But just one more time, let's make love
One more time, it ain't much, fuck 'em all, let's be us
Summer's soft sweetness
Call late drunk, you hang up
What a mess I made us, sense, I make none
It's complicated, keepin' me up late
Can't concentrate, you're always on my brain
If it's love, then why the fuck it come with pain?
I just think that's some bullshit
Okay, it seem invitin', trust me, she's a titan
This week she like him, next week they fightin'
Need protection, all your dresses bulletproof
You're safe with me, girl

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak &  Mac Miller]
I can't keep on losin' you
Where the hell you goin'?
Where you takin' this trip to? Wait!
Don't move, don't stay, too
I can't keep on losin' you
Where the hell you goin'?
Wait!
Where the hell you goin'?

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I can't keep on
Losin' you over complications
Gone too soon, wait!
We was just hangin'
I can't seem to hold onto
Dang
The people that know me best
The key that I won't forget, too soon
I can't keep on losin' you

[Post-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you

[Outro: Mac Miller]
Woo


Planet God Damn

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, I think I'm stuck inside nostalgia
My mind are in the times when this love was so divine
But now it's feelin' like without ya
Feelin' like how the fuck did
We get into a place we ain't accustomed to lovin' inside of
I know I'm out of my mind more often than not
You know I'm used to givin' this all that I got, yeah
It's not a waste when that smile on your face
You tell me you outta place, you parked in my spot
Okay, baby, this a piece of cake
We could lay up on the beach, you could feed me grapes
This my favorite song, spin it ‘til the needle breaks
We could quit the whole game, do the real estate thing
It's how you beat the case
Put in work, turn that pussy to the office
Be on top of your game, this here a goddess

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
And I ain't here to break a promise
I'm just tryna keep it honest, and honestly

[Chorus: Njomza]
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Okay, no mishaps, this, that, and the third
Don't go back on my word, yeah, I keep that shit gift-wrapped
Your pussy a ride better than Six Flags, I'm in that
No takeaways, no givebacks
No question, we've been through adolescence
And changin' direction, yeah, I paid attention to it
It's never been easy but now it's gettin' ruthless
A little more pain, that's just better music
Girl, what's on your brain? 'Cause that head is stupid
Lotta people suck a dick, but you can execute it
Perfect timin', don't you add another second to it
Don't you ever-ever-ever-ever-ever do it
Yeah, head pollution, conflict resolution
Keep it true, everything that I do witchu

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
I ain't here to break a promise
I'm just tryna keep it honest, and honestly

[Chorus: Njomza]
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na

[Outro: Njomza & Mac Miller]
We don't have to pretend
We both know how it ends
I just need your presence
Wanna feel you feel me
Yeah, you just landed from the Planet God Damn, damn
Wanna feel you feel me
Wanna feel you feel me
You just landed from the Planet God Damn, damn
Wanna feel you feel me
Wanna feel you feel me
