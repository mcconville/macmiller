Everybody

[Intro]
Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody just wanna have a good, good time
I think you know the reason why
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody's gotta live
I think you know the reason why
Yeah, sometimes the going gets so good, yeah
But then again it get pretty rough, yeah
But when I have you in my arms, baby
You know I just can't, I just can't get enough

[Chorus]
Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody’s gonna try to have a good, good time
I think you know the reason why

[Verse 2]
Saw a blind man standin' on the corner, baby, yeah
And he couldn't hardly tie his shoes, yeah
Harmonica and guitar strapped around his neck
But he sure could, he sure could play the blues

[Chorus]
Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody's gonna try to have a good, good time
I think you know the reason why, yeah

[Verse 3]
Feel like I've seen a million sunsets, yeah
If you're with me I'll never go away
That's when I stopped and I took a look at my baby
She said, "If you're with me, I won't go away"

[Chorus]
Because everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody's gonna try to have a good, good time
I think you know the reason why


Good News

[Verse 1]
I spent the whole day in my head
Do a little spring cleanin'
I'm always too busy dreamin'
Well, maybe I should wake up instead
A lot of things I regret, but I just say I forget
Why can't it just be easy?
Why does everybody need me to stay?
Oh, I hate the feeling
When you're high but you're underneath the ceiling
Got the cards in my hand, I hate dealing, yeah
Get everything I need then I'm gone, but it ain't stealing
Can I get a break?
I wish that I could just get out my goddamn way
What is there to say?
There ain't a better time than today
But maybe I'll lay down for a little, yeah
Instead of always trying to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry
Half the time I don't even know what I'm saying it about

[Chorus]
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like you when I'm down
But when I'm flying, oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?

[Verse 2]
When it ain't that bad
It could always be worse
I'm running out of gas, hardly anything left
Hope I make it home from work
Well, so tired of being so tired
Why I gotta build something beautiful just to go set it on fire?
I'm no liar, but
Sometimes the truth don't sound like the truth
Maybe 'cause it ain't
I just love the way it sound when I say it
Yeah, it's what I do
If you know me, it ain't anything new
Wake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while
But I heard that the sky's still blue, yeah
I heard they don't talk about me too much no more
And that's a problem with a closed door

[Chorus]
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like you when I'm down
But when I'm flying, oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?

[Verse 3]
There's a whole lot more for me waitin' on the other side
I'm always wonderin' if it feel like summer
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
I'll finally discover
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
Then I'll finally discover
That it ain't that bad, ain't so bad
Well, it ain't that bad, mm
At least it don't gotta be no more

[Outro]
No more, no more, no more, no more
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Hey, hey
Mm, hey, mm, mm, mm


I Can See

[Verse 1]
I'm so close I can taste it
The man on the moon keep playing
Practical jokes, planting the mirrors and smoke
That I fade away in
You be complaining
And I can't explain it
I guess, nothin' compare to the feeling
The feeling amazing
Now I'm switchin' location
'Cause Heaven too far when you live in the basement
I'm lookin' for balance, I'm in an oasis
Well, I need somebody to save me, hmm
Before I drive myself crazy

[Chorus]
And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, show me something
And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, something I can see

[Verse 2]
Yeah, don't tell me to stop
Let me keep goin' until I cannot
Life is a fantasy until you wake up in shock
Hittin' the ground, I'm hittin' the ground, I fell from the top
You never expect to drop, so hold on, but
That just the way it goes, your God don't wait for no one
And when that's all you know, it keep you on your toes
You got so far to go, but look at where you came from

[Chorus]
And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, show me something
And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, something I can see


Surf

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey
Said

[Verse 1]
Where are you goin'? Can I come too?
The whole world is open, a playground for me and you
And we could be fine, shit, who the hell knows?
It's your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your nose
Head and your shoulders, your knees and your toes
I dream of this moment
Will it come true?
The whole world, they know it
They just waitin' for me and you
And she, just like I
Got her head in the clouds
Don't need to be lower
Before it's all over, I promise we'll figure it out
I ain't comin' down
Why would I need to?
So much of this world is above us, baby
They might tell you that I went crazy
I'm just tryna read you
Ooh, ooh, oohh
Ooh-ooh-oohh

[Chorus]
I know we try
And the days, they go by
Until we get old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow
People, they lie
But hey, so do I
Until it gets old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow

[Post-Chorus]
Let it go, let it be
We're all we need today
Let it go, let it be
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verse 2]
Yeah, well
Sometimes I get lonely
Not when I'm alone
But it's more when I'm standin' in crowds
That I'm feelin' the most on my own
And I know that somebody knows me
I know somewhere there's home
I'm startin' to see that all I have to do is get up and go

[Bridge]
Goin', goin', goin' before I'm gone
Gotta get goin', goin', goin' before I'm gone

[Chorus]
Ayy, and I know we try
Days, they go by
Until we get old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow
People, they lie
But hey, so do I
Until it gets old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow

[Instrumental Outro]


That's on Me

[Chorus]
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, it's all my fault
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, I know

[Verse 1]
Time moving slowly, I'm bouncing my head off the wall
I know nobody that knows where we're going at all
Don't, don't, don't, don't let me down
And I'll pick you up, I'll help you get around

[Chorus]
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, it's all my fault
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, I know

[Bridge]
I'll let it go
I'll cut the strings
Today I'm fine

[Verse 2]
I don't know where I've been lately, but I've been alright
I said good morning this morning and I'll say good night
Don't, don't, don't, don't wait around
We'll take the stairs that gets us into there
It's unfair when I'm being too proud, but

[Chorus]
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, it's all my fault
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, I know


Woods

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, things like this ain't built to last
I might just fade like those before me
When will you forget my past?
Got questions, ask, you know the stories
And you need to let me know
When you're leaving, where you go
Can I come?
Do you believe me, are you close?
Yeah, even if you don't
That'll get you sprung

[Chorus]
Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, don't run away, love
Hate love, heartbreak will have you bankrupt
Too many days in a daze, better wake up
I put your face in a place where the space was
Nobody makes you feel like you but (Do I?)
And you don't know what you should do
You just lookin' for someone to make you move, ooh, tell me (Do I?)
I make this planet feel like home
It's us versus time, the door is closing
So far beyond all our control
You saved a soul so close to broken
It's so much better when you wait
Forever and a day, that's all I got
Put it together then it break
All the energy it take, it never stop

[Chorus]
Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?

[Bridge]
Yeah, I never slip, I never fall
I tried to tell you 'bout a better life
And get involved big or small
It's been my fault, I keep it safe, it's in the vault
Blindfolded, keep it going 'til we hit a wall, yeah
I'm never going through the motions
I'm just tryna lay your body down slowly
We can only go up
We can only go up

[Chorus]
Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?


Circles

[Verse]
Well, this is what it look like right before you fall
Stumblin' around, you've been guessing your direction
Next step, you can't see at all
And I don't have a name, I don't have a name, no
Who am I to blame? Who am I to blame though?
And I cannot be changed, I cannot be changed, no
Trust me, I've tried
I just end up right at the start of the line
Drawin' circles
Mmm
Well, I drink my whiskey, and you sip your wine
We're doing well, sittin', watchin' the world fallin' down, its decline
And I can keep you safe, I can keep you safe, mmm
Do not be afraid, do not be afraid
You're feeling sorry, I'm feeling fine
Don't you put any more stress on yourself, it's one day at a time
It's gettin' pretty late, gettin' pretty late
Damn, and I find
It goes around like the hands that keep countin' the time
Drawin' circles


Once a Day

[Verse 1]
Once a day, I rise
Once a day, I fall asleep with you
Once a day, I try but I can't find a single word
I wonder what they know
I wonder if they ever even cared at all
I wonder, do they see their own reflection in the rain
And look away?

[Chorus]
Everybody keep rushin'
Why aren't we taking our time?
Every now and again, baby, I get high

[Verse 2]
Don't ask me what I think
It never really mattered what I had to say
I just keep waiting for another open door
To come up soon
Don't keep it all in your head
The only place that you know nobody ever can see
You're running low on regret
No tears, that's keeping you wet
I think you gettin' it now

[Chorus]
But everybody keep rushin'
Why aren't we taking our time?
Every now and again, baby, I get high

[Bridge]
And everybody means something
When they're stuck on your mind
But every now and again, why can't we just be fine?

[Outro]
Once a day, I rise
Once a day, I fall asleep with you
Once a day, I try but I can't find a single word


Hands

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, why don't you wake up from your bad dreams?
When's the last time you took a little time for yourself?
There's no reason to be so down
Rather fly around like there's no ground
And I, I bet you wish you hadn't ate
'Cause carrying this weight'll break your glass knees
Yeah, don't need no chauffeur, fuck the backseat
No, I stay behind the wheel and never half-speed

[Verse]
Get the fuck out of my car, this ain't a taxi
They love to see me lonely, hate to see me happy
Call me what you want, she call me "daddy"
Got a knack for gettin' nasty, every day we keepin' tally, yeah
Ooh, it's true I want it badly
Hit the zoom, I be movin' like a athlete
(Now concentrate) No reason to be that upset
I'm busy trippin' 'bout some shit that still ain't even happen yet
I keep it honest as honesty gets
Don't know why I'm always talkin' if I'm not makin' sense
I've spent my life livin' with a lot of regrets
You throw me off my high horse, I'd probably fall to my death
(Bad behavior) It's obvious you're not on your best
I might just pull your card if it's on top of the deck
Give me, give me what I need and then I'm onto the next
That's what we callin' cause and effect

[Chorus]
Yeah, why don't you wake up from your bad dreams?
When's the last time you took a little time for yourself?
There's no reason to be so down
Rather fly around like there's no ground
And I, I bet you wish you hadn't ate
'Cause carrying this weight'll break your glass knees
Yeah, don't need no chauffeur, fuck the backseat
No, I stay behind the wheel and never half-speed

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Blue World

[Intro]
It's a blue world without you
It's a blue world alone

[Chorus]
Yeah, well, this a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do one-eighty
I ain't politickin', I ain't kissin' no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady
Mmm, don't trip, we don't gotta let him in
Don't trip
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I let it go
But I never go with it, mhm, yeah

[Verse 1]
Okay, cool as fall weather, fuck your bullshit
I'm here to make it all better with a little music for you
I don't do enough for you
Without you, it's the color blue, ooh, don't trip
I was in the city, they was talkin' that shit
Had the homies with me, all a sudden, they split
We ain't even worried, we just laughin', that's rich
You know how it goes, it ain't broke, don't fix

[Refrain]
Hey, one of these days
We'll all get by
Don't be afraid
Don't fall

[Verse 2]
Think I lost my mind
Reality's so hard to find
When the devil tryna call your line, but shit, I always shine
Even when the light dim
No, I ain't God, but I'm feelin' just like Him, ooh, don't trip
See, I was in the whip, ridin', me and my bitch
We was listenin' to us, no one else, that's it
That's a flex, just a bit, let me talk my shit
Say my head got big, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah
Well, this a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do one-eighty
I ain't politickin', I ain't kissin' no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady
Mmm, don't trip, we don't gotta let him in
Don't trip
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I let it go
But I never go with it, mhm

[Bridge]
Don't trip
Don't trip
Don't trip
Well, if you could see me now
Love me and hold me down
My mind, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes

[Chorus]
Yeah
Well, this a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do one-eighty
I ain't politickin', I ain't kissin' no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady
Mmm, don't trip, we don't gotta let him in
Don't trip
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I let it go
But I never go with it, uh

[Refrain]
Hey, one of these days
We'll all get by
Don't be afraid
Don't fall in line


Hand Me Downs

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I'm thinkin' maybe I should thank you
Oh baby I should buy you another round
'Cause you care, and I swear that I'm here, but I'm there
It's getting harder to hunt me down
Get away to a place where the lakes such a great view
Leave the bank, couple hunnid thou'
I made it, but I hate once I build it I break it down
Might just break me down

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
And all I ever needed was somebody with some reason who can keep me sane
Ever since I can remember I've been keeping it together but I'm feeling strange
Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new? You get used to the bullshit, the screws they go missing
It's likely they might be but...

[Chorus: Baro Sura]
You remind me
Shit, I need to stay in line
You damn well are a great design
You, despite being an only child
Say you need more of a family 'round
Let's turn these genes into hand me downs
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, well I'm just being honest my conscience ain't doin' bad
Because I try to minus the problems that I attract
And half the time the wheels that's in the back of my mind
Just keep on turning 'til the tires flat and burn until the fire crack
I do not lie though, facts may seem a little farfetched
That's only 'cause I may be make believe and full of darkness
When I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place
Walk and drop in change inside your empty guitar case
That's charity um, I move carelessly that's why I'm always tripping
I guess that's like electrolytes you help me go the distance
Not too efficient but the way it's always been
Until the day we have to meet again

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new? You get used to the bullshit, the screws they go missing
It's likely they might be but...

[Chorus: Baro Sura]
You remind me
Shit, I need to stay in line
You damn well are a great design
You, despite being an only child
Say you need more of a family 'round
Let's turn these genes into hand me downs
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down


Floating

[Intro]
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
La-di-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, there's a room somewhere up above the trees
And once you get there, you don't ever wanna leave no-no-no, no (Ah, ah)
Feelin' good, feelin' free
When I can finally get away
When I can finally get away (Away, away, away, away)
I need to see it with my own eyes
Hope it remembers and it knows my face, face (Ooh-ah-ooh-da-da-mm-bah)
I'll come and see you if you don't mind
When I can finally get away
When I can finally get away

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, get away
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haa
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, get away
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
There's a place right up above the clouds (Yeah)
Somewhere in between later and right now, right now (Right now, right now, right now)
And you don't have to be scared, no
I'll be there when I can finally get away
When I can finally get away (Ooh-ah-ooh-da-da-mm-bah)
Soarin' uncontrollably, gravity ain't holdin' me down (Ha-ha), maybe I—
I'll fly to your front door some time
When I can finally get away
When I can finally get away (Get away, get away, get away)

[Outro]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, get away
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haa
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha (Get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away)
Get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away
Get away, get away
Get away, get away
Get away, get away


Right

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's been a while without your face
But I saw your picture on the wall the other day
Too much distance, too much space
You need to come back home and run along, yeah
I'm waiting for the light to change
You ask me how I've been and I'm good, I can't complain
Times get harder, things get strange
All I know, I don't want you gone

[Chorus]
I know it hasn't been easy lately
But you don't want to leave me, baby
And you know I hate to keep you waiting
But when it's right, girl, it's right, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Days turn into nights
Conversations turn into fights, we gon' be alright
Love turn into life
Girl, you been burnin' so bright, let me turn off the lights
Stay awake 'til the mornin', yeah
It ain't always great, but it's never borin', yeah

[Verse 2]
And I been itching for your love
Don't want to feel a single thing if it ain't your touch
I get drunk and become none
Just want to stumble into us
But baby, don't stop now 'cause it ain't over, yeah
Three years ago I was so dumb
Clueless, young and stupid, but look at who I have become
I ain't gonna break your heart, promise it's always safe
Baby, don't go now, pull me closer

[Chorus]
I know it hasn't been easy lately
But you don't want to leave me, baby (Woah)
You know I hate to keep you waiting
But I know when it's right, girl, it's right, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Days turn into nights
Conversations turn into fights, we gon' be alright
'Cause love turn into life
Girl, you been burnin' so bright, let me turn off the lights
Stay awake 'til the mornin'
It ain't always great, but it's never borin'

[Outro]
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah (Ha-ha)
But when it's right, girl, it's right, alright
Ooh-ooh, mhm
Ooh-ooh, mhm
Ooh-ooh, mhm


Complicated

[Verse 1]
Outside is cloudy, but I like that better (Better, better)
Behind the wheel, but still ain't on my way
Some people say they want to live forever
That's way too long, I'll just get through today

[Chorus]
Without any complications (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Does it always gotta, does it always gotta
Gotta be so complicated? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Well, I'm way too young to be gettin' old

[Verse 2]
And all I wanna do is look, but I can't see, baby
Who you talkin' to while you talkin' to me, baby?
Let me, let me know if I can see you later
We could make it easy

[Verse 3]
Inside my head is getting pretty cluttered (Cluttered, cluttered)
I try, but can't clean up this mess I made
'Fore I start to think about the future
First, can I please get through a day?

[Chorus]
Without any complications (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Does it always gotta, does it always gotta
Gotta be so complicated? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Well, I'm way too young to be gettin' old

[Outro]
Some people say they want to live forever
Without any complications (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Does it always gotta, does it always gotta
Gotta be so complicated? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Well, I'm way too young to be gettin' old
