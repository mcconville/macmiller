Man in the Hat

[Verse 1]
Boy a fool, wonder what's cool
Tryin' to figure out what to rhyme about
I heard your mans ran cryin' to his mommy and his daddy
When the cops drove by his house, so who you tryin' to dial?
If you lookin' for a answer, you probably gon' find it now
And to the man in the hat standin' lookin' at his watch:
Motherfucker, well, the time is now
Go and clap your hands, let me hear you say, "That's the jam"
See, I wouldn't be shit if I ain't have no fans
Can't sit down, kids, you have to stand
Just put your hands up, you don't have to dance
Here, we get it poppin' like it's Pakistan
Iraq, Iran, I have them sayin', "Mac's the man"
The maximum, comin' through to pass you bums
So if you ain't got no money, better ask for some
Hey, we came to get down, have a good time
Bring the champagne out and the good wine
We gon' be sippin' and whippin' the sickest whips
Spittin' the illest shit that's sicker than syphilis
Comin' in the back door, yellin', "Fuck a list"
Fans takin' pictures while I'm tryin' to take a piss
We came to party, didn't come to give a shit
Now sing this part, it goes like this, hey

[Chorus]
All my people in the front
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
Everybody in the back
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you're feelin' that funk
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you like it like that
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
All my people in the front (Front)
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
Everybody in the back (Back)
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you're feelin' that funk (Funk)
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you like it like that (That)
Go and clap your hands (Hey), go clap your hands

[Verse 2]
H-h-h-h-hold up
Every day they wanna ask me when I'll grow up
I show up 'cause fans will go nuts
Tell the girls, "It's cool, look but don't touch"
I'll be home soon as I can, I don't rush
'Cause girl, you're baby, girl, you're good, just don't fuss
I wanna hear y'all clap, just like that
Keep it goin', I'ma bring it all back
H-h-h-h-hold up
Every day they wanna ask me when I'll grow up
I show up 'cause fans will go nuts
Tell the girls, "It's cool, look but don't touch"
I'll be home soon as I can, I don't rush
Baby, baby, girl, you're good, just don't fuss
I hear these couples fightin' all the time, not us
We have a good time, like to get fucked up
What? What? Goin' hard tonight
Under 21, but find me at the bar tonight
Hey, drivin' 'round in my car tonight
Makin' music that ain't hard to like
I got the heart to write
A couple bars, I might go do
Somethin' crazy, I may be lazy, love me or hate me
You know it's the same me
And it goes a little somethin' like this...

[Chorus]
All my people in the front
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
Everybody in the back
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you're feelin' that funk
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you like it like that
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
All my people in the front (Front)
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
Everybody in the back (Back)
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you're feelin' that funk (Funk)
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you like it like that (That)
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands

[Outro]
Boy a fool, wonder what's cool
Tryin' to figure out what to rhyme about
I heard your mans ran cryin' to his mommy and his daddy
When the cops drove by his house, so who you tryin' to dial?
If you lookin' for a answer, you probably gon' find it now
And to the man in the hat standin' lookin' at his watch:
Motherfucker, well, the time is now (Time is now)


My Team

[Intro]
Maybe I can get a little more high

[Verse 1]
(Haha) Come and talk shit, who the boss, bitch?
Moon the crowd now, Randy Moss shit
Sharks swimmin' in the water you'll get tossed in
And fuck a first class, I'm in the cockpit
It's obnoxious, it's bumpin' out my car
Bass'll shake your dinin' room table from afar
Down the street, they can hear me pretty clearly
Makin' in a night what your daddy pull in yearly
See a little style, I got mine's patent
Always rock a smile, never a distraction
Brand new Mercedes, cameras when I back in
Fuck with Single Ladies, yeah, I did a little actin'
Love me on the weekend but hate me when I'm workin'
Overly dedicated and overly medicated, for certain
Buy her a brand new purse and it's gravy
I ain't talkin' Slim when I say these bitches Shady

[Chorus]
Chicken sandwiches and turquoise beads (Yup)
Tattoo sleeve, pair of Levi's jeans (Yup)
Never get no sleep (Yup), you know all about me
Come and meet my team, bitch (Yup)
Meet my team, meet my team (Yup, yup, yup, yup)
You know all about me, come and meet my team (Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup)
Bitch, meet my team, you know all about me (Yup, yup, yup, yup)
Come and meet my team (Yup, yup, yup, yup)

[Verse 2]
And if you see me, I'll be with my team (Team)
Got my homie Billy, probably in Supreme ('Preme)
Jimmy or Will be sellin' shirts to the fans
While TreeJay, Clock, they got you raisin' your hands (Ayy)
Then you got Q, that's my right-hand man
Shout out Little Dave, sittin' shotty in the van (Van)
Everyone I came with, travel like a gang, bitch
City after city, everybody speak our language
We just flex (Flex), get bootlegs checks (Checks)
Got all these people askin', "What's next?" (What's next?)
Success and a dumb fresh life
Takin' bets, you tryin' to lose a little money tonight?
I'm on top of the stage but under the lights
We invadin' your crib and fuckin' your wife
So have a ball, no sports, no Spaldin'
Poppin' champagne, gon' spray it on her awning

[Chorus]
Chicken sandwiches and turquoise beads (Yup)
Tattoo sleeve, pair of Levi's jeans (Yup)
Never get no sleep (Yup), you know all about me
Come and meet my team, bitch (Yup)
Meet my team, meet my team (Yup, yup, yup, yup)
You know all about me, come and meet my team (Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup)
Bitch, meet my team, you know all about me (Yup, yup, yup, yup)
Come and meet my team (Yup, yup, yup, yup)

[Outro]
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours
What happened to that shit you was talkin' before?
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours
What happened to that shit you was talkin' before?
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours
What happened to that shit you was talkin' before?
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours
Goes: one, two, three, four


Hole in My Pocket

PA Nights

[Verse 1]
Hey, ten thousand dollar hands, million dollar plan
My fam's still the only people that really know me for who I am
Damn, got me askin' when I got this fly
The type to change because of fame, I'm just not that guy
Still sippin' on my 40 when the cops drove by
When I go, gotta tell my girl to stop, don't cry
See, I-I-I been buyin' these diamonds
All designer clothes and a Benz just to drive in
Autograph signin' must've got to my head
Fuck that, I've been the same lil' mu'fucka
Always down to share my shit, melody with snare kick
So I don't give a fuck about some lames I rode the ferry with
My larynx is imperative to live, music's what I need, boy
Destroy all of these fake me's, they decoys
Everywhere I go, these companies give me free toys
These random strangers just treatin' me like we boys

[Chorus]
Ayo, Pennsylvania nights (Nights), 9:30 flights (Flights)
Thinking to myself, where does all this go? (Go)
No time to care (Care), got more I can share (Share)
By now, this life is all I know
So this is all I know (Know), this is all I know (Know)
Taught myself to walk, then got up and took flight (Took flight)
Hey, bullshit's always gonna be bullshit (Bullshit)
So make a toast to a good life (Good life)

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, ten thousand dollar hands, billion dollar plan
Listenin' to jams while I'm sittin' in my van
This is who I am, wrote these lyrics on my DNA code
Happy as hell, MDMA, yo
Fuck a job, there ain't no one that I call my boss
We just tryna work so we can blow up like a Molotov
And it kinda wake me up like a coffee shop
Thinkin' 'bout my people who was murdered in the Holocaust
Got me thankful just for life by itself
And there's way more people here I should be tryna help
Am I wrong for spendin' money how I do? (Prolly yes)
It's just funny old people see the logo on my chest
You got ya thumb held high? We can be friends
Other people pretend we hang out on the weekends
These fuckers lil' bit creepy, so we just leave them
Say, "Get some rest," when I die, I'ma sleep in

[Chorus]
Ayo, Pennsylvania nights (Nights), 9:30 flights (Flights)
Thinking to myself, where does all this go? (Go)
No time to care (Care), got more I can share (Share)
By now, this life is all I know
So this is all I know (Know), this is all I know (Know)
Taught myself to walk, then got up and took flight (Took flight)
Hey, bullshit's always gonna be bullshit (Bullshit)
So make a toast to a good life (Good life)
Pennsylvania nights (Nights), 9:30 flights (Flights)
Thinking to myself, where does all this go? (Go)
No time to care (Care), got more I can share (Share)
By now, this life is all I know
So this is all I know (Know), this is all I know (Know)
Taught myself to walk, then got up and took flight (Took flight)
Hey, bullshit's always gonna be bullshit (Bullshit)
So make a toast to a good life (Good life)

English Lane

[Verse]
Don't even know my schedule, levels reachin' several
Rose petals deliver, make you feel special
They thought the money should've changed it
Slide's still blue, why the world keep tryin' to paint it?
When the life around you changes, try to keep your sameness
Try to keep your brain maintainin' through the lameness (Lameness)

[Chorus]
Sometimes I just wanna go
Back to Blue Slide Park, the only place I call home (Home)
I hope it's never all gone (Gone), don't think it's ever all gone (Gone)
Sometimes I just wanna go
Back to Blue Slide Park, the only place I call home (Home)
I hope it's never gone, forever long (Forever long)


Smile Back

[Chorus]
I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'ma smile back, smile back

[Verse 1]
Tell them haters, call your army, bring your tanks
I'm a big boy with a big boy bank
Self-employed, independent, once you start, don't take no breaks
Work until I get it, I bet it's gon' take a second
But once I start up my engine, I'm gone, too fast to catch him
I'm Lennon mixed up with UGK, maybe try that purple drink
What I'm on is strong, yours weaker than seven days
You sweeter than crème brûlée, presidential head of state
Dopest mothafucka since before I hit the seventh grade
Elevate, Buddha shit, cooler than what coolest is
Slick without no lubricant, bullshit, you just full of it
Stupid bitch, keep on hatin', I'ma keep on doin' it
Spend a day as me, boy, you couldn't get the shoes to fit

[Chorus]
I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'ma smile back, smile back
I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'ma smile back, smile back

[Verse 2]
They used to tell me I was fake, they would hate, now they on my dick
Most Dope is my family, have respect for my conglomerate
Rollie on my wrist, I ain't rich, but I'm still coppin' shit
Jerm is on the beat, he got that heat, hold up, drop it quick
And bring it back
I could change the world with just a single track
Underage table in the back, smokin', drinkin' yak
Pittsburgh, let me show the world just where my city at
On the map, illest city out, I guess that's just a fact
I'ma live in Rome, drink Patron and have a ball
After all, only get one life, so there's no time to stall
I'ma do it, stupid dudes with all exclusive shit to move with
Just a few kids tryna bullshit, still my boys I straight up grew with

[Chorus]
I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'ma smile back, smile back
I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'ma smile back, smile back


Diamonds & Gold

[Intro: Future]
I'm able to, uh
The stage in my life where I'm
Where I feel like I can conquer anything and everything
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

[Pre-Chorus: Future & Drake]
Sippin' on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Poppin' tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Ballin' in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor 'cause I been drinkin' that dirty
Bring that Ace by the case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup, my drink with me

[Chorus: Drake & Future]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing

[Verse 1: Drake]
And you know what I need
From you when I get home (Yeah)
You better not be on the phone
Talkin' up a storm like you usually do
Talkin' to your friends like you usually do
Tellin' them I never spend time with you
It's hard to find a time, we been

[Pre-Chorus: Future & Drake]
Sippin' on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Poppin' tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Ballin' in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor 'cause I been drinkin' that dirty
Bring that Ace by the case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup, my drink with me

[Chorus: Drake & Future]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing

[Verse 2: Future]
I'm familiar with this cash flow
And if you juggin', you can vouch for me
I did it my way, you can vouch for me
I put the cocaine and the powder in the couch, homie
Whenever I step outside the house, I keep that glocky on me
Bad bitches wanna come by, the paparazzi on me
I got so many bad bitches that I barely want her
I'm barely paying attention, baby, I need substance
I know you spent some time puttin' on your makeup and your outfit, but

[Chorus: Drake & Future]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing

[Outro: Drake]
You doing me dirty (Dirty, dirty)
You doing me dirty
Doing me dirty
You doing me dirty
You know (Yeah, dirty, dirty)
How we let it get like this, I don't know (Yeah)
But that nigga can't save your soul (Nah)
Doing me dirty, you doing me dirty
Haven't even heard from you (Yeah)
How can you live with yourself?
I haven't even heard from you
How can you live with yourself? (Uh)
Ungrateful
Ungrateful (Hmm)
Your mom'd be ashamed of you
I haven't even heard from you, not a single word from you
Ungrateful (Hah)
I'm too good for you, too good for you (Yeah)
You should go back to him, perfect match for you, unstable (Hah)
Doing me dirty (Dirty, dirty)
You're making me nervous
I haven't even heard from you
You look drained, you look exhausted
Girl, them late nights ain't good for you
Really starting to show on you
Don't hit me up when it's good for you
Ungrateful


Frick Park Market

[Intro]
Uh, let me get a turkey sandwich, uh (Woo), lettuce, tomato (Bitch)

[Verse 1]
My name Mac Miller, who the fuck are you?
Well, my crew too live, but I ain't Uncle Luke
And I ain't no hipster, but girl, I can make your hips stir
From Pittsburgh, smoke papers or a swisher
Welcome (Woo,) to the Cam Rellim chronicles
Lookin' out my monocle
I'm dodgin' obstacles, I gamble like the Bellagio
You cock-a-roach, I'm heroin 'cause everything I talk is dope
Type to leave it clean and fuckin' shiny, word to Mop & Glo
Tryin' to get a mansion, ain’t nobody here gon' find my room
Money gon' be green, I guarantee you that my slide stay blue
So press play, I start from scratch and never use no template
The next day, these losers always goin' with what's trendy
My pen game is somethin' these motherfuckers have never seen
All City Champion, everybody is second-string
No need to testify (Testify,) for the best is I (Best is I)
And anybody in my way gon' be left to die

[Chorus]
I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back (Back)
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
If you don’t hold me down, for all I care, you can starve, bitch
I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back (Back)
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
Anything you need, you can find it at the market

[Verse 2]
I got my own stickers now, so literally I’m everywhere
Hundred different shoes, still feel the need to cop a fresher pair
These motherfuckers treat me like it’s just my second year
Fool, you better get prepared
Don't know 'bout you but all my rhymes is deadly here
Frick Park Market, where we kickin' out the garbage
Sick bars, I’ve been a boss, so stick around and watch it
Didn't fit around no college campus, chillin', writin' on top of planet Earth
Fuck who's first, It’s just 'bout who the hardest
On my own, too, fuck who's sayin' different
Every time I rhyme, I get that Punxsutawney feelin'
I’m the starter, you a fill-in
You a martyr, I’m just killin'
Gettin' harder with each time I write
Wish I could rewind last night
I had so much fun just kickin' it and goin' in
Don’t call me Malcolm if you didn't fuckin' know me then
And if you lonely, girl, I could be your only friend
You got some shit to say? I suggest you hold it in, bitch

[Chorus]
I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back (Back)
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
If you don't hold me down, for all I care, you can starve, bitch
I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back (Back)
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
Anything you need, you can find it at the market

[Outro]
Yeah
And this is Blue Slide Park


Under the Weather

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, I bet it must be nice, chillin' every day
Not really doin' shit, a couple million in the bank
I'm workin' all the time, never gettin' me a break
But fuck it that's fine, not a minute go to waste
I just want to be a legend, every second I gotta be goin' in
A part of me wanna chill, but a part of me wanna win
No college payin' my bills, I'm sayin' just what I feel
'Cause haters be lookin' stupid, when you just keepin' it real
I got too much on my mind, to care about the internet bullshit
But the people comin' up say I'm forgettin' who I am
Just because they random dudes I went to school with
I'm cool with it, chillin' with some buddha smoke
I always do it big like a Jewish nose
Cadillacs, I'm tryna to get a few of those
Fuck stress, everything'll be okay, like...

[Chorus]
How did you know (Know)
I was feelin' so under the weather (Weather)
This evenin'?
If you don’t mind (Mind)
Come rest your mind (Mind)
I think it's all gon' be okay (All gon' be okay)
And they say they love you (Love you), but they kiddin'
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don’t mind (Mind)
Come rest your mind (Mind)
I think it's all gon' be okay (All gon' be okay)

[Verse 2]
Do you believe in fairy-tales, dreams come true?
One day you gon' make it
If they gave you a handout, and you were down bad
Would you take it?
I found that bein' famous in reality, well, it ain’t shit
'Cause you could have the world in the palm of your hand
But it don’t mean a thing ‘til you change it
Listen, baby, I'ma be great now
We can watch a movie, fuck it, stay up late
I’ma make my way to the top, every day I get closer
When I was young, they told me to wait until I'm older
They turned a cold shoulder to me
And now they want tickets to my shows for the free
"Hey, Mac, can I take a pic? Can I have an autograph?"
Bitch, suck my dick

[Chorus]
How did you know (Know)
I was feelin' so under the weather (Weather)
This evenin'?
If you don’t mind (Mind)
Come rest your mind (Mind)
I think it's all gon' be okay (All gon' be okay)
And they say they love you (Love you), but they kiddin'
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don’t mind (Mind)
Come rest your mind (Mind)
I think it's all gon' be okay (All gon' be okay)

[Bridge 1]
Go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi if I'm ridin' by
I know it sucks with a 9 to 5
But everything'll be alright
We go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi if I'm ridin' by
I know it sucks with a 9 to 5
But everything'll be alright

[Bridge 2]
Under the weather, shit'll get better
Under the weather, shit'll get better
The hate ain't gonna last forever, so
I just smile, it's whatever
Under the weather, shit'll get better
Under the weather, shit'll get better
Don't let nobody say you can't
Heart beatin' like a 808

[Bridge 1]
Go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi if I'm ridin' by
I know it sucks with a 9 to 5
But everything'll be alright
We go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi if I'm ridin' by
I know it sucks with a 9 to 5
But everything'll be alright

[Chorus]
How did you know (Know)
I was feelin' so under the weather (Weather)
This evenin'?
If you don’t mind (Mind)
Come rest your mind (Mind)
I think it's all gon' be okay (All gon' be okay)
And they say they love you (Love you), but they kiddin'
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don’t mind (Mind)
Come rest your mind (Mind)
I think it's all gon' be okay (All gon' be okay)


Blue Slide Park

[Intro]
Blue Slide Park
(It's Blue Slide Park, man)
Uh (It's fuckin' Blue Slide Park)

[Verse 1]
Hey, I got these Ray-Ban shades
Kinda look like somethin' Lennon would rock
It seems like now I got a couple bags whenever I shop
Louis shoes, Polo socks, some name brand dumb shit
Logo never make a man, but I'm still blowin' thousands on it
No clue what I'm callin' my album
Fans be at my van screamin', callin' me Malcolm
Never knew the outcome be this much cash now
Bank account lookin' like a George Jung stash house
Young and actin' out, the topics that I rap about
Be varyin' from politics to bitches pullin' asses out
That's exactly how I do this as a rapper
I'm nuttin' in her mouth, you tongue kissin' her after
Daughters' moms kinda want me neutered
But they also want the kid to cum right on they cooter
Have the music soundin' better than guitar tuners
Plus I'm doin' shows daily, call me Jon Stewart
So who you know that's iller than Mac Miller and company?
It's like I planted money seeds right underneath the fuckin' tree
Now I got a hundred G's, so none of y'all can fuck with me
Yeah, I said it publicly, so run and tell your mother, motherfucker
I said run and tell your mother, motherfucker

[Interlude]
Hold up, Jerm, let me spit the second

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I breeze past haters in the E-Class quickly
In deep, did a hundred songs and that’s this week
Shit keeps goin' on and on
We just tryna go bananas like it's Donkey Kong
Yeah, on my grind, always need to work
So I be eatin' good, you be eatin' dirt
If you talkin' shit, you gon' see me smirk
While the DJ be scratchin' 'til the needles burst
A couple screws probably loose in my head
Holler at my girl, tell her bring that doobie to bed
I'm a regular guy with an irregular life
Except I'm a Lamborghini if it's racin' a bike
Who knew that I can turn-turn sound into somethin' so cool?
Fresh kids, see me, I'm bustin' the moves
Comin' in soon to a theater near you
Creep in your kitchen, start eating your food
Girls tryna fuck, I don't be in the mood
No time for pussy when money in the room
Ooh, I switch flows, switch rhythm
Sick spittin', unlimited ammunition, hey

[Outro]
Blue Slide Park


Loitering

[Intro]
Cam Erlim, is that it?
Oh no, Cam Rellim, haha
Cam Rellim at your service, with these verses

[Verse 1]
Ayo, I'm park bench chillin', burger patty grillin'
Everybody love to say my name is Rumpelstiltskin
Call up Wolfgang Puck, tell him come and bring a meal in
My stomach full, I'll go against the world like Scott Pilgrim
Way above the buildin', bungee jumpin' down
They say I'm gettin' trendy like I come after a pound sign
Hashtag Mac, this ain't backpack rap
Give a fuck 'bout what you sayin' after platinum-plated plaques
Take it back, cookin' on them hoes, you can make a casserole
Mad that I can rap so well, and everything all factual
Ain't worth it, if not laughable, I'm off the wall as racquetball
Dick that keep your girl awake all night, they call it Adderall
Youngin' on his grind, workin' harder than your dad work
Black shirt, Rellim Cam, that's my name said backwards
Ask first, hell nah, treat 'em like a bellhop
Let 'em hold my bags and give a tip for that ass, boy

[Chorus]
I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Never be too old to be chillin' at the playground
Shorty come and kick it at the swings (At the swings)
I'm way too old to be chillin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Cops comin', muthafucker, stay down
Girl, I'll be waitin' at the swings (Hey) (At the swings)

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I'm Blue Park slidin', go-cart drivin'
Got this rap shit down to a science
My Louis belt way nicer than Orion's, confined to an assignment
You won't finish in the kitchen, like appliance
Is just a muthafuckin' kid, say my head is gettin' big
No, that's my ego, trippin' somewhere where they need a ski-slope
Rockin' in the fall like a pea-coat, freaks with a deep throat
Students run the class, y'all should keep notes
Drunk then I'm hard to understand, Don Vito
Ace in the Casino, I'm Robert De Niro
I be low, key though, young nino with my jeans low, heh
Your girl love it when I speak slow, she go *Woman moans*
You can hear the way she's moanin'
Started back at midnight, at it 'til the mornin'
Wake up with some mornin' wood
Hit it before work, yeah, I'm sure she would
All my female fans like, "I'm sure it's good," haha

[Chorus]
I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Never be too old to be chillin' at the playground
Shorty come and kick it at the swings (At the swings)
I'm way too old to be chillin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Cops comin', muthafucker, stay down
Girl, I'll be waitin' at the swings (At the swings)


One Last Thing

[Verse]
Everybody wanna ask where I came from
Young kid who bang drums, money, don't you worry, I'ma make some
Somebody changin' the world, it only takes one
Never scared of death, but I ain't ready for that day to come
A million people in the world, I don't hate one
Even them dummies robbin' people with some fake guns
Make mistakes young boy, that's just what I heard
And you don't ever figure out what you don't want at first
I got another verse, invincible and nothin' hurts
100 words, comin' up with what'll have your bubble burst
We can just fuck, you don't need to take my number first
Gettin' right to it, I ain't really tryna cuddle first
I used to try everything with her, but nothin' worked
Got her backwards like she heard the thunder first
These are the days of our lives, and I ain't lyin' kid
Bein' free, tell me what kind of crime that is
It said it can't let me spit a couple sentences
Always good penmanship, make sure you all remember this
You just entered into Blue Slide Park
The place where dreams comin' true, that's where you find heart
Up until the sun come up, yeah, my crew grind hard
See me out throughout the day, but you won't find me in the dark
Say I'm smart with remarks, such remarkable bars
Who knew this music would get me a couple cars
That just sit in park 'cause I'm out somewhere travelin'?
Mackin' on the preschool honeys, you were somewhere tattlin'
Mac has been known to always spaz again
Every single track with him, "Oh, he's just so talented"
Dream of countin' money 'til my fingers get some calluses
King with many palaces, a fuckin' golden fork to eat my salad with
I observe, askin' what did he design
I see an artificial future for a digital mind
Muhammad Ali, yeah, I'm him in his prime
Just that normal kid in class you was sittin' behind
Didn't really pay attention to him spittin' his rhymes
But now you see his car, try gettin' inside
No, hell no
Haha, I wanna go back home

[Outro]
Keep it, hold up (Can't remember what the day's like)
Late night, can't remember what the day's like
Reminiscin' on stop signs and brake lights
'Cause it seems that I'm always on the move (Move, move)
When they gonna let me back home?
Yeah
I wanna go back home
I wanna go back home


Missed Calls

[Intro]
Hey
It's like

[Verse 1]
Long days, longer nights
You keep startin' fights, think you always right
Call you up to tell you I ain't comin' home tonight
Say you wanna leave me, it's just talkin', but I know you might
Now get along, I get along, I go
You sing along to every song that you know
You play your part, I'm playin' mine, you breakin' hearts, ain't breakin' mine
Since growin' old is takin' time, I'm actin' like I'm eight or nine
Tryin' to move on, talkin' to my old friends
See me, say what up and I'm actin' like I don't know them
Causin' so much problems, why you doin' that, doin' that?
Rippin' people's hearts out, you too cute for that, cute for that
I been on the same shit
We run into each other and it's like we don't even speak the same language
I guess people always goin' through changes
Didn't think I would lose you once I got famous

[Chorus]
Said, "Baby
I got missed calls and e-mails all going into detail
'Bout how you just not happy and you think you gotta leave
So go (Go)
I'll be fine on my own" (Own)
Said, "Baby, I got missed calls and e-mails all going into detail
'Bout how you used to love me, I keep changing like the leaves
Hell, go (Go)
You'll be fine on your own" (Own)

[Verse 2]
She tell me
"You an asshole, superficial douchebag
Wishing that you knew that, you could have these shoes back
All of this perfume back, necklaces and jewels back
All the shit you buy me" she said, "I want you back
I can't be seen again with you and none of your friends
It's so hard to pretend that it's like it was way back when
I thought you used to be the one, I guess you don't have time
'Cause all you do is grind and it's got me losin' my mind
You just don't, don't, don't love me like you used to
Think I'm 'bout to lose you
I'ma end this now before things just confuse you
Kept breakin' promises you said you'd keep
So you can leave a message at the beep"

[Chorus]
Said, "Baby
I got missed calls and e-mails all going into detail
'Bout how you just not happy and you think you gotta leave
So go (Go)
I'll be fine on my own" (Own)
Said, "Baby, I got missed calls and e-mails all going into detail
'Bout how you used to love me, I keep changing like the leaves
Hell, go (Go)
You'll be fine on your own" (Own)


Of the Soul

[Intro]
Uh, looks like I wrote this song on paper
First time I did that in like three years
My handwriting is—, is horrible and I can barely read this
Hmm

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, don't even know what's in my head anymore though
Uh, figured out I ain't gonna go to college, Lee Corso
Fuckin' girls, but I never kept the door closed
Want you all to hear the way I put it in her torso
I ain't normal, I'm clinically insane
I guess it's the result of drugs that enterin' my brain
All of a sudden, every legend keep on mentionin' my name
All that does is show me that my life will never be the same
Police tryna figure out how to get me locked up
I tell those cops, "Suck dog nuts," haha
Arrivin' to the party in a chariot
Lookin' for a scary bitch that I can pop her cherry pit
I'm very sick, yes, very ill
Eternal Sunshine, Jim Carey feel
At the amusement park, scared of heights, Ferris wheel
Double dare me to kill?

[Chorus]
Got some soul like De La do
They say I'm new, it's nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere you go, these people hate on you
It's déjà vu, déjà vu (One time for the grind)
A little soul like De La do
They say I'm new, nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere I go, these people hate on you
Déjà vu, déjà vu

[Verse 2]
Wind chimes, sick rhymes
Been high on this incline
Tryna get my money stackin' tall, 6'9"
Have some caviar, sip wine
Sacrificin' sanity, sacrificin' normal
Purpose is for people in the plural
Form never formal, an art form, not a mural
Work four bars that are tighter than your cornrows
See a girl that's lookin' horny in the fourth row
Ha, I just put it in her mouth, ortho-
Dontist, manipulatin' phonics, put 'em into sonnets
Let me put you on this, nastier than Nas is
Bubonic plague, bacteria that's tryna find a way
Spread, like yolk of a broken egg
Talkin' shit? You just diggin' your grave

[Chorus]
Got some soul like De La do
They say I'm new, it's nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere you go, these people hate on you
It's déjà vu, déjà vu
A little soul like De La do
They say I'm new, nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere I go, these people hate on you
Déjà vu, déjà vu

[Verse 3]
Hypothetically of dope, I kick incredibly
Potentially could be the remedy for happiness without the ecstasy
No methamphetamines, hot, 110 degrees
Visually stunnin', gotta see it on the LED
When I was 17, I thought I had it figured out
Now I see what it's about, went in down a different route
It's crucial, three new schools, life with a spoonful
Of sugar, yeah, I need my medicine
Fuckin' Mary Poppins, gotta treat her like the president
Represent all these fuckin' people that I never met
Some expect me to be the greatest ever
Hear me on the radio, shit'll change forever
Now I'm just a pop sensation, fuck your expectations
I'ma be the best, have some patience
You thought that it was great, then poof
It was nothin' but some déjà vu

[Outro]
Haha, yeah


Up All Night

[Intro]
One, two
One, two, three, go

[Chorus 1]
(Hey, hey, hey, hey) Fill it up, fill it up
(Hey, hey, hey, hey) Fill it up, fill it up
(Hey, hey, hey) Fill it up, fill it up
(Hey, hey, hey) Fill it up, fill it up

[Verse 1]
Let me get another cup, please
I ain't drivin' home, so you can have my keys
Got a bunch of tricks all hidden in my sleeve
So I'ma get drunk, won't be leavin' 'til three
Yeah, I got a reputation of gettin' wasted
Everything in sight, homie, we ain't tryna save shit
Leave the spot dizzy, so nah, I can't see, bitch
Sexy bartenders always get a really mean tip
Life's so good, please enjoy it
End of every night when your head's in the toilet
Yeah, we party hard, give a fuck about employment
Kill the whole bottle, we'll be spinnin' like a coin flip
Yeah, we ain't goin' home no time soon
I'm on shot number four, times two
Stand by the keg, let the hoes find you
Gettin' nice, I'll be up all night

[Chorus 2]
(Hey, hey, hey) We stayin' up all night
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow
We up all night

Drink, drink, drink, drink (Hey, hey, hey)
Drink 'til we can't no more (Hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
Head starts spinnin' and my legs get wobbly
Every mornin' wake up, liquor in my coffee
Yeah, I'm tryna party, find a open house crib
Screw the law, we just some motherfuckin' kids
Never listen to nobody who was tryin' to tell me "No"
'Cause I got no problem bein' way outta control
Got these ladies goin' crazy at every single show
But you ain't drunk enough until you takin' off your clothes
Not me, you can do you
Do some crazy shit that's poppin' up on YouTube
Finna rock out, I ain't talkin' U2
Passin' out, wakin' up without shoes
Live life on the edge, sharper than a razor
Like my liquor straight, I don't ever need a chaser
Have a good time, ain't no reason we should fight
Party with me, we stayin' up all night

[Chorus 2]
(Hey, hey, hey) We stayin' up all night
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow
We up all night
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow
We up all night
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow
We up all night
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow
We up all night

[Post-Chorus]
Drink, drink, drink, drink (Hey, hey, hey)
Drink, drink, drink, drink (Hey, hey, hey)
Drink 'til we can't no more (Hey, hey, hey)
We gon' drink, drink, drink, drink (Hey, hey, hey)
Drink, drink, drink, drink (Hey, hey, hey)
Drink 'til we can't no more (Hey, hey, hey)

[Post-Chorus]
