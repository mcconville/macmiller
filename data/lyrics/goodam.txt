Two Matches (feat. Ab-Soul)

[Produced by Sounwave]

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
When I was just a kid
Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich
No more problems and no more tricks
I set my sights high 'cause in my lifetime
Man, I've seen some shit
Yeah, I swear to God
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job? (Bullshittin')

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul, Mac Miller, Ab-Soul]
Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun (Let's have some fun)
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul & Mac Miller]
In my lifetime, my whole M.O. was to get this M-O-N-E-Y
Sabotage the wealthy and enrichen the poor (Soul)
Long story short, that's one of my long-term goals
My anatomy is platinum, gold is old
Lettin' my hair swang like Pootie Tang (Uh)
I done seen some spooky things through these Gucci shades
Acute to cute bitches, niggas with drums
Niggas with bands like the Martin Luther King parade (I have a dream)
But can't we all just get along? (One day)
Like Martin Lawrence would say and get along with our day
She say, "Soulo, you so crazy and deranged", I say, "I know"
Roll that weed, nigga! (Shake that ass, ho!)
Most Dope, Top Dawg off the leash
Sounwave on the beat (Wizzo!) and our key is anarchy
Your confidence is caca to a kamikaze
Still wishin' peace to all y'all, pardon my nostalgia

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
When I was just a kid (Okay)
Dreamt (Soul,) that one day we'd all get rich (Okay)
No more problems and no more tricks (Okay)
I set my sights high 'cause in my lifetime
Man, I've seen some shit (Woo)
Yeah, I swear to God
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job? (Bullshittin')

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul, Mac Miller, Ab-Soul]
Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun (Let's have some fun)
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun

[Post-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Yeah, I've seen some shit (I've seen it all)
How'd I end up in a place like this? (In this)
Swear to God, seen some shit (I've seen it all)
Light a match, keep it lit, yeah, it is what it is

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
In this lifetime, be the time of your life
It's been a while but it'll come back to you just like ridin' a bike (Alright, alright)
And as a child, I was curious, my mind was the dirtiest (Uh-huh)
Curse words was probably my first words (Affirmative) (God damn)
My home run derby shit (Derby shit), was makin' profit out the park
Even the brightest minds will hang around at dark sometimes
I had to fight for mine, Tyson in his prime, used to idolize
Had to right my wrongs, the days short, the nights is long
I'm makin' corpses when it's on and eatin' swordfish
From gigantic portions, Lord is important, but I am stronger
I'm a monster with the heart of a lion, divide and conquer
Walk on water, won't be long 'til I'm flyin', that's my departure (Jesus)
I'm a goner
Shoot you down from the sky with eyes of a archer (Ah, yeah)
Better find that thing you die for (Ah, yeah)
(I don't know what I get so high for) (Ah, yeah)
I'm a problem and as hard as I try, no hidin' from karma
You'd be traumatized seein' what came across these eyes
There was a time...

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
When I was just a kid
Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich
No more problems and no more tricks
I set my sights high 'cause In my lifetime
Man, I've seen some shit
Yeah, I swear to God
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job?

[Bridge: Mac Miler]
Take your time
Don't close your eyes
Life happens in a flash
And you don't wanna miss that

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul, Mac Miller, Ab-Soul]
Blow out your candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun (Let's have some fun)
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun (Go have some)

[Post-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Yeah, I've seen some shit (I've seen it all)
How'd I end up in a place like this? (In this)
Swear to God, seen some shit (I've seen it all)
Light a match, keep it lit, yeah, it is what it is

[Outro: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul]
We all grow up to be gangstas (Gangstas), playas (Playas), snitches
Freaks and strangers, politicians (Strangers, politicians)
Good and evil people (Good and evil)
Sinners, saints and everything in between
Wicked as Aleister Crowley, know﻿ me
Lately I've been thinkin' (Lately)
I've, I've been thinkin'
What's the difference? What's the difference?
Nothing at all! (Never mind us)
Ayy, let me just add one more thing, Josh
*Match being lit*
Ayy, ayy, watch that shit, man, you almost burnt me, nigga!


Rush Hour

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Woo!
Okay, woo!
Yeah (Okay)
Yeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I give a fuck less and less every day (Okay)
The more you give a fuck, I guess the less you make (Money)
Homie we just out here tryna elevate (Skrrrrt)
Heaven is a crime scene, stay behind the yellow tape (Whoop whoop)
I started makin' money in eleventh grade
Soon as I learned that the more you do, the less you wait (Uh-huh)
Got a bigger crib, always use the extra space
Shit was so different in 2008 (Woo)
Growin' pains, fill the open veins with Novocain
Relapse, I eat that, I don't complain
I'm just ramblin'
You want war? It’s N64, Blitz Champion (Sucker!)
Out of space channelin', brain-damagin'
Heavy rain, game cancelin', proud to be American, yeah

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
They tell me, "Get yourself straight (Woo)
How much more money can you make?" (Okay, okay, okay)

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich (Old and rich)
Maybe get married to a local bitch (Local bitch)
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit (Over shit)
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness (No way)
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich (Old and rich)
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness (Okay)
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit (Over shit)
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness (Okay)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I'm a deranged motherfucker (Woo), took too many uppers (Woo)
Now it's rush hour, Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker, yeah (50 million dollars!)
I stuck around the past six summers (Woo)
Karma is a bitch and that bitch don't love ya, yeah
We was in the attic, you could smell the weed
Bitches gettin' naked, we was selling E
Bitches kissin' bitches just like Ellen D (Ellen D)
In the kitchen whippin' biscuits, givin' generously (Thank you)
I thank the Lord I made it out, no STD (Word)
Lost a few too many brain cells, I'm special needs, yeah

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
They tell me, "Get yourself straight (Straight)
How much more money can you make?"

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich (Old and rich)
Maybe get married to a local bitch (A local bitch)
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit (Over shit)
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness (No way, no way, no way, no way, no way)
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich (Old and rich)
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit (Over shit)
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness (Okay)

[Outro: Vinny Radio]
Ladies and gentlemen in attendance, good morning
It's the BabyFace Don Dada checking in
And I want you to know
It ain't about complaining, it's about maintaining
Y'know I'm talking about?
Don't ever become content because you will repent
Ya feel that? Go get it
That's your life, go live it
Pass me my Hennessy and my Grand Marnier
If you will


Doors

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah

[Verse: Mac Miller]
I know it's been a minute since I've been away
Didn't mean to cause you pain, I just needed to escape
Ain't sayin' that I'm sober, I'm just in a better place
I'm on my way over, I'm just runnin' kinda late
And you know I've been through all the highs
I've seen all the lows, lost track of time
I'm coming home, you know my mind
Places it goes, and it goes, and it goes

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
It's only a game
Don't be afraid
These doors will close
And people change
One day you'll go
Right now you're here
Don't leave just yet
Don't disappear

[Outro: Elle Varner]
Good morning, baby

Uh, uh, (Uh, uh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo, now

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I got a little bit of money fillin' my pockets, roll around like I run this shit
I got a system filled up with toxins, I've been broken-hearted, now it's fuck that bitch
Getting high to deal with my problems, fucking bitches, getting drunk as shit
But these bitches getting obnoxious, they nuttin' to me though, I love this shit
Go long days, longer nights, talk too much, the wrong advice, all the lights
And call my life, doctor, doctor, will you help me? Get me healthy, keep it low, this where hell be
Ain't shit you can tell me now, fuck this rap shit, bitch, I'm sellin' out
Ooh shit, with my new bitch, you jealous now, smokin' weed at the crib watching Belly now (Alright)
All the pain that they causin' like, fuck it, we ballin', now everythin' straight
You feeling the feeling, I'm chilling, just living, I'm burning away
Conversations we having, I'm getting too static, too much on my plate
Lord, I need me a break

[Chorus: Miguel & Mac Miller]
But I'll be good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
I'll be good by the weekend (Yeah)
Everything good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
Everything will be good by the weekend (By the weekend)

We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight (It's a weekend)
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight (It's a weekend)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I been having trouble sleeping, battling these demons
Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathing: is it money, fame or neither?
I been thinking about the places that I frequent, all the people that I see
I’m just out here livin' decent, what do it mean to be a G? Yeah (Alright)
And all the time we fall behind, bitches in the concubine, I call her mine, crazy
She ain't God as I, I make water wine, pausin' time, it's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line, I cross the T's and dot the I's, wondering, well
Wonderin' how I got this high, fell asleep and forgot to die, Goddamn
I'm poppin' them downers and drinkin' them powders, faded
Get it over the counter, I'm stuck on the browser, like, how did I make it?
These bitches don't know me, this shit is so lonely until she get naked
Don't even know what the day is

[Chorus: Miguel & Mac Miller]
But I'll be good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
I'll be good by the weekend (Yeah)
Everything good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
Everything will be good by the weekend (By the weekend)

[Outro: Miguel]
Mondays I think of you, but I ain’t tripping on it
Tuesdays I’m hittin', gotta get my hands up on ya
Wednesdays I'm lit wit'chu, you know you're staying over
Thursdays I’m sick of you, I got to get rid of you
'Cause Fridays are always the start of the time of
My life, alright
When I get faded you hate it, but, baby
It’s gon' be alright
Haha, alright


Break The Law

[Intro: Juicy J]
Get high, breakin' laws
Get high, breakin' laws

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah
Okay, I wake up with the taste of pussy still in my mouth
Bitch in my bed, homegirl still asleep on the couch
My head is bangin' like Metallica, swallow a bottle of Advil up
Then head back to the bedroom where she suck me dry like
Dracula
It's The Young Miraculous Mister Love-to-Grab-His-Nuts
Never let a bitch inside, fuck her in the Acura
Aurora borealis with the shine, my aura gorgeous
Dinner with 40 courses, bunch of horny whores who fornicate
To formulate a fortune, more in the race of horses, I am
My homies got my back, they all Verizon (A-a-a-and?)
I bring this to you la-la-la-la-la-la-live, man
You gon' need at least five hands to hold my finance
I am fe, fi, fo, fum, the giant
The best thing out of Pittsburgh since Clemente with the Pirates
I tell 'em, "Shhh, this middle finger sign for silence"
Ain't a fuckin' way I'm keepin' quiet

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
Yeah
I been ridin' through the city, blowin' smoke out the window (Yeah)
Cops is on patrol, they lookin' out for all the crim'nals (Woo)
I been a lot of things, I ain't never been a bitch though (No)
Rules to the game (Yeah,) you know how this shit go (Let go)
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Break the law)
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Hell yeah)
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Break the law)
Oh no (Break-break, break-break the law)
La, la, la (Let's go)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
So many people told me that I wouldn't be shit, but now I walk
Around with money and my hand on my dick, I think I'm special
I'm drinkin' whiskey out the bottle 'til I black out
One million, two million, shit, I'm losin' track now
(Yeah) Comin' to you live inside the crack house
Started with a dub and then I made it to a half ounce
Then I turned it to a pound (Wow,) turned that to a house (Wow)
Turned that to a career, how the fuck did I get here? (Woo)
Spendin' all your time just gettin' high will drive you crazy
(Crazy) I killed the game like Jeffrey Dahmer did the '80s
Speedin' down the freeway gettin' head in my Mercedes
Givin' me all of this money was crazy, shoulda known better, no pressure
Dope seller, smarter than your professor
Hoes, I don't stress her, put a bitch down like Old Yeller
The flow's stellar, stella ella ola
Have you ever been? Shit, I pro'bly could've been the president

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
Yeah
I been ridin' through the city, blowin' smoke out the window
Cops out on patrol, they lookin' out for all the criminals
I been a lot of things, but I ain't never been a bitch though
Rules to the game, you know how this shit go
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Break the law)
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Hell yeah)
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Break the law)
Oh no (Break-break, break-break the law)
La, la, la, la

[Outro: Juicy J & Mac Miller]
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Break the law)
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Break the law)
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Break the law) (La, la, la, la, la)
Break the law, break-break, break-break the law (La-la-la-la)
Break the law (La-la-la, la-la-la, la, la)
Break the law (La-la-la, la-la-la, la, la)
Break the law (La-la-la, la-la-la, la, la)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la


In The bag

[Skit: Mac Miller & Domo Genesis]
Drivin' in the car, Sunday afternoon, chillin'
Who is comin' up to my car? What?
I know niggas think you white
And you not 'bout to go in with these bars, my nigga (Uh)
But that is not the truth (Okay)
Word to God, I take another shot of Hennessy
If you don't go in right now
I need your fade right now, bruh
What the fu—

[Intro: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
Okay (Yeah), okay
Yeah, the hustle continues, man
Okay, yeah
You's  a wild motherfucker, Mac

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
So this the music that made white people mad
Make 'em mad
Yeah, this the shit to blow your speakers out
This the shit you dream about
You can have the world, it's up for grabs
Up for grabs
Leave with everything, 'cause everything is in the bag
In the bag

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
When I was younger, I was just a little wild motherfucker
Tryna be like all the people on the television
They had all the bitches that I wanted
All the cars and all the extras
Anything money could buy, they was spendin' millions (Cash)
I was tryna get to pimpin'
I was tryna blow up, talkin' demolition
That boy got the devil in him, swear he need a exorcism
I'm all by myself, got no competition
Keep it real in a world that's filled with politicians
You want to talk about your problems?
Don't you wish the life you lived was motherfuckin' awesome?
Don't you wish you had all the pussy?
Too much money you could spend?
So you could get away and never see your shitty life again?

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
So this the music that made white people mad
Make 'em mad
Yeah, this the shit to blow your speakers out
This the shit you dream about
You can have the world, it's up for grabs
Up for grabs
Leave with everything, 'cause everything is in the bag
In the bag

[Post-Chorus: ScHoolboy Q & Mac Miller]
And we never done with this shit, here we come with that shit
I ain't stressin', I ain't worried 'bout nothin', don't trip
It's amazin' all the shit that I be comin' up with
Shit is real, tell 'em chill, keep on bumpin' my shit

[Verse 2: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
Yeah, all my life I been a fuck up, never did anything right
That's why everyday I'm fucked up
My mom pray to Jesus Christ (Jesus Christ)
Askin' somebody to save me (Somebody save that boy)
But I'm way too motherfuckin' crazy
(No one can save that boy)
Yeah, all the kids is doin' drugs (Drugs)
They just want to break the law and find someone to fuck
(They wanna find someone to fuck)
Yeah, nobody doin' as they told (Little bad ass kids)
Yeah, everyone out of control (Fuck it, that's just how it is)
I'm self made, dream came true, I'm a miracle
Every time I put my dick inside a bitch, it's spiritual (It's holy)
Got the whip that say "wealthy" on my steerin' wheel (Brand new car)
Brand new model bitch made me waffles and some cereal
That's what I call a good mornin'
Your mom work an extra job just to get you Jordans
Just so you could show up at your school lookin' fresh, sayin'
"I don't know 'bout you, but me, I'm important"
I'm so gorgeous
You got money in your pocket, you the shit (You the shit)
You got everything you want
And bitches on your dick (On your dick)
Yeah, a couple grand got you feelin' like the man
Everybody walkin' tall 'til they trip
They just cut the check
You had to go and cop the whip (You cop a whip)
Drive up to your ex's crib
And tell her she ain't shit (She ain't shit)
There's just somethin' about the money
Make a motherfucker crazy
When I die, bury me in my Mercedes, God damn

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
So this the music that made white people mad
Make 'em mad
Yeah, this the shit to blow your speakers out
This the shit you dream about
You can have the world, it's up for grabs
Up for grabs
Leave with everything, 'cause everything is in the bag
In the bag

[Post-Chorus: ScHoolboy Q & Mac Miller]
And we never done with this shit, here we come with that shit
I ain't stressin', I ain't worried 'bout nothin', don't trip
It's amazin' all the shit that I be comin' up with
Shit is real, tell 'em chill, keep on bumpin' my shit

[Bridge: ScHoolboy Q & Mac Miller]
Bumpin' my shit
Bumpin' my shit
Bumpin' my shit
Bumpin' my shit

(Oh, we gonna take care of this right—)
Listen to me, nigga can't park the car
Nigga can't go to the store, nigga can't—
(Tell me about it) Nigga can't text his homie on the phone no more
I didn't talk about nigga, that's the ticket
(Well, that is dangerous)
I'm like, "Nigga, I just got my L's last week," but anyway
(You just got your license?)
The niggas pulled me over (Yeah), asked me for my license and registration (Right)
I give 'em my license and registration (As you should)
Then he got the nerve to tell me I smell like weed (Pshh)
Nigga, you asked for my license and registration
Of course I smell like weed, nigga, I smoke weed!


Perfect Circle / God Speed

[Part I: Perfect Circle]

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh
Ooh—ooh—ooh
Yeah ([?])
Ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh
Ooh—ooh (Fuck you) Yeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I came for whoever is in charge (Here)
Suggest you go and get yourself a weapon and a guard (Here)
They need some coffee, everybody sleepin' on me
Goin' round door-to-door, settin' off alarms (Beep, beep, beep)
All that horse shit, you shoulda left it at the barn
Keep a stallion, tell her gallop to the store and get cigars, yeah
Too many whips, gotta get a new garage made (That's the ball game)
I might steal one just to drive it in a car chase
Me and my bizarre ways (Lord have mercy)
I moved up from a Private to a Sergeant, you can see it from the scarface
Hidden in a dark place, swimmin' in a shark tank
Give a bitch a little bit of change, she a game in a arcade
(Time crisis) Not a second to lose
I'm the motherfuckin' Bible, that's forever the truth (Amen)
And this is not another case of the celebrity blues
The devil wit' me and he tell me to shoot, boom

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Murder, murder, murder, murder (Oh yeah), what would you do?
Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for somethin' to do
Can you draw a perfect circle?
Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?
I wash these pills down with liquor and fall (I do)
Leave it to me, I do enough for us all (I do)
Got what you need if you like breakin' the law
My mother raised me a God (Hey)
(Fuck you)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah
Blame the drugs, got me sinnin' on a weekday
Drunk as fuck, do a buck sixty on the freeway (Skrrt)
Givin' y'all the freebase, hidden in the middle of a briefcase
That's hidden in a subwoofer, beat case
Used to wanna know how a freak taste
Now I'm in it in an instant like replay
Broad's a baton, pass her off like relay
Why I'm so mad on my B-Day?, she say
"I thought you got sober," then I said
"I wish you'd stop bein' a bitch and get to mindin' your business"
Told me, "Money has changed ya"
I get to thinkin', how rarely do I visit? How'd I get so egotistical?
I'm a Buffalo Soldier
Heaven is a mile away, the trouble, much closer
I'm only 23 but my mind is older, and it'll forever be
Dead presidents to the homies, death to my enemies

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Murder, murder, murder, murder (Oh yeah), what would you do?
Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for somethin' to do
Can you draw a perfect circle?
Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?
I wash these pills down with liquor and fall
Leave it to me, I do enough for us all
Got what you need if you like breakin' the law
My mother raised me a God (Hey)
(Fuck you)

[Bridge: Ab-Soul & Mac Miller]
A goddess told me "Good mornin'" when I woke up
(Fuck you)
You know I had a good mornin' when I woke up
(Fuck you)
Gotta thank God every mornin' then I woke up
(Fuck you)
Would you remember me if I never woke up?
Bye-bye (Fuck you)
I've been a sinner, I'm just tryna stay
Warm through the winter, and I'll be on my way
I'm just a drifter, in endless seas of whispers
I just need some shelter, give me shelter from the wind

[Refrain]
Ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh (Hahaha)
Ooh—ooh—ooh
Woo—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh
Ooh—ooh—woo—woo

Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system

[Part II: God Speed]

[Interlude: Miller McCormick]
"Yeah, man, I wish you were here, happy holidays
Um, I love ya. And I hope you have a good night/weekend/I hope I talk to you soon, alright, godspeed"

[Verse: Mac Miller]
Oh yeah
I thought I'd have it figured out by now
Shit would be simple, problems would be in the past by now
Me and the homies would be sittin' on millions
Reminiscin' on times when we were so broke and livin' in Oakland just chillin'
I thought I'd have it in the bag by now
I thought that we’d be kickin' back by now
I know that life is a bitch
I know that life is a bitch, I thought we'd put her in a cab by now
But I'm stressin', I can’t relax
Swallowin' my pride and I'm hidin' what’s makin' me mad
Everybody sayin' I need rehab
'Cause I'm speedin' with a blindfold on
It won't be long until they watchin' me crash
And they don't wanna see that
They don't want me to OD and have to talk to my mother
Tell her they coulda done more to help me
And she'd just be cryin'
Sayin' that she'd do anything to have me back
All the nights I'm losin' sleep
It was all a dream, there was a time that I believed that
But white lines be numbin' them dark times
Them pills that I'm poppin', I need to man up, admit it's a problem
I need to wake up before one mornin' I don't wake up
You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make ya
I'm too obsessed with goin' down as a great one
But if you wait too long they gon' find someone to replace ya
So I guess this is a letter
To all my brothers, Most Dope, that's forever
I love you more than words could express
And this the part that Q start cryin', if he ain't already yet
I did my best to be a leader you respect
At times I became weaker, got defeated by regret
So tell my baby I love her
And if she give me the chance I'll put a seed inside her, make her a mother
Just know that there's a place
Where all my people worry free and e'rybody straight
Every devil don't got horns, every hero ain't got capes
Open up my eyes, shit, I'm finally awake, good mornin'
Yeah, good mornin'

[Outro: Mac Miller & Vinny Radio]
Yo Vin, it's the morning, you gotta go to work
Alright
Yo, you gotta—you gotta be at work in like ten minutes, yo
I'm good, man
You good?
I'm straight, yo, what's good?
When you going?
You gotta go pick up the dry cleaning and shit still?
Man, fuck that shit, I'll skip
You 'bout to go to work?
Mmm
Aight, what time you gotta be at work?
I don't know... soon
You Democrat or Republican?
Uh... I don't know anymore
Would you vote for a female president?
Mmm, I don't care what gender or race you are


Clubhouse

[Intro]
Yeah
(Real shit) Yeah
(New shit) Yeah

[Chorus]
I done been through it all, every brick in the wall
Got a bitch I'ma call when I'm tryna fuck
You ain't shit to the God, need to get you a job
'Cause you live in the mall, bills pile up
I'ma chill in the spot with a spliff, I been lifted a lot
But I still ain't high enough
All the mills that I got, couple whips in the lot
There's a list to the top, you could sign me up
(Yeah) You could sign me up
Sign me up
They can't bring me down, can't hold me down, can't bring me down
Sign me up
Can't burn me down, can't hold me down, can't bring me down with you
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Above ground, 'bout thirty thou' miles up
Tell the bitch, "Slow down," like dial-up
She go down first and she climbin' up
Wanna let me cut, tell her, "Line it up"
Little bit much, I'm a wild one (Woo)
All I do is fuck hoes, drink tiger blood (Yummy)
Since I came in the game, they been sour
I'm the plug, get your motherfuckin' power up
Mind your business (You in my office)
And I go get it (I need all it)
I stay lifted, smokin', sippin'
Fixes fixin' all my problems (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I done been through it all, every brick in the wall
Got a bitch I'ma call when I'm tryna fuck
You ain't shit to the God, need to get you a job
'Cause you live in the mall, bills pile up
I'ma chill in the spot with a spliff, I been lifted a lot
But I still ain't high enough
All the mills that I got, couple whips in the lot
There's a list to the top, you could sign me up
(Yeah) You could sign me up
Sign me up
They can't bring me down, can't hold me down, can't bring me down
Sign me up
Can't burn me down, can't hold me down, can't bring me down with you
Yeah

[Interlude]
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Woo), oh-oh-oh-oh (Good mornin')
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I was a nobody, now my name's on the list
Couple ki's of uncut cocaine on the wrist
And I let my nuts hang on a bitch
All the money that we spend on champagne is ridiculous
And it is us, elixir in my cup
Give the bitches drugs, a dick to suck
And I don't see why these kids wanna grow up to be just like me (Yeah)
I was a nobody, now my name in they mouth
I came for a steak, but I left with the cow
And they hate when you great though
Ain't shit change but my checkin' account (Mac Milly)

[Chorus]
I done been through it all, every brick in the wall
Got a bitch I'ma call when I'm tryna fuck
You ain't shit to the God, need to get you a job
'Cause you live in the mall, bills pile up
I'ma chill in the spot with a spliff, I been lifted a lot
But I still ain't high enough
All the mills that I got, couple whips in the lot
There's a list to the top, you could sign me up
(Yeah) You could sign me up
Sign me up
They can't bring me down, can't hold me down, can't bring me down
Sign me up
Can't burn me down, can't hold me down, can't bring me down with you
They can't bring me down, can't bring me down, can't bring me down with you
Ca—, you ca—, ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-can't bring me down

Wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow

[Chorus]
Yeah, I
Made a promise to my mama that I'll bless her
With some grandkids, she can spoil 'em
Until then, I'm getting dollars, I'm just doing what I gotta
Can a man live? And it's all day, homie
I'm a God, give the whole squad a job, get 'em all paid
Came a long way from all-state, yeah, now we All-American
(Salute me, shoot me) Shit, we All-American, yeah (Salute me, shoot me down)

[Verse]
I swear to God I put the hero in heroin (Dope), these flows kilos
I could sell snow to a ski slope
I could sell evil to the devil, nonbelievers to a temple
Shit, I could sell water to a speedboat
And these eyes is iconic
I went pro, made profit, now I keep some dead faces in my pocket
Gettin' faded, I been stoned all week (All week)
But what's a God without a little OD? Just a G
Twisting my weed, easing my mind
Why you worry about me? Stop tripping, I'm fine
Swear these bitches done lost it lately
You put the ho in honest baby, so complicated
And I may be a little arrogant, I'm aware of it
I know (Goddamn,) I know
I got a problem, I'ma take care of it, weight I'm carrying, gotta let it go
It won't hold me down no more

[Chorus]
Made a promise to my mama that I'll bless her
With some grandkids, she can spoil 'em
Until then, I'm getting dollars, I'm just doing what I gotta
Can a man live? And it's all day, homie
I'm a God, give the whole squad a job, get 'em all paid
Came a long way from all-state, yeah, now we All-American
(Salute me, shoot me) Shit, we All-American
(Salute me, shoot me down)

[Post-Chorus]
We ain't goin'
Nowhere, we ain't
Goin' nowhere, we can't be
Stopped now, 'cause this rap shit's for life
We ain't goin'
Nowhere, we ain't
Goin' nowhere, we can't be
Stopped now, 'cause this rap shit's for life

[Bridge]
Back then I had a dream
I'd get this money, man
I know my life would change
Just need a hundred grand
Back then I had a dream
I'd get this money, man
I know, my life would change
Just need a hundred grand

[Segue]
Yeah
Back when I first made a hundred grand
Yeah, back when I first made a...
Yeah
Back when I first made a hundred grand
Yeah

[Part II]

[Chorus]
Yeah, back when I first made a hundred grand
Thought I was the shit (Oh, you the shit?)
When I first made a hundred grand
Thought I was a king (Oh, you a king?)
When I first made a hundred grand
Couldn't tell me nuttin' (I ain't sayin' nuttin')
When I first made a hundred grand
Made a hundred grand (Let me get some money)

[Verse]
Yeah, okay
Back then they used to call me little
But now I'm ridin' somethin' clean in a coat made of armadillo
They haven't got the memo, I'm sayin' I'm the shit, though
Tryna make it complicated when this shit is simple (Simple)
Tell me what you wanna be, what your dreams is (What your dreams is)
A hundred G's in my jeans, I'm a genius (I'm a genius)
Sin everyday, someone save me please
And get schooled, homie, change degrees (Uh-huh)
I'm the plug, what you need though? (What you need though?) I'm goin' beast mode
I keep a freak, even when she underwater she can deep throat (Wait, what?)
I made a mill' before I paid a bill (Okay)
'Cause fools worried about a wave, I'm a Navy SEAL (Okay)
Come with me, I can make your life change for real (Woo)
Always had a dream of stuntin', it ain't nothing unless you runnin' shit (Woo)
Just a young ma'fucker with a plan (With a plan)
Thought I was the man

[Chorus]
Yeah, back when I first made a hundred grand
Thought I was the shit (Oh, you the shit?)
When I first made a hundred grand
Thought I was a king (Oh, you a king?)
When I first made a hundred grand
Couldn't tell me nuttin' (I ain't sayin' nuttin')
When I first made a hundred grand
Made a hundred grand (Let me get some money)

[Outro]
(Time flies) Let me get some money
Let me, let me get some money
(Yeah, you know time flies) Malcolm, can we go to mall?
I just need some shoes and my nails (Try to catch it) and then can we stop at Chipotle?
(Time flies) Let me get some money
(Yeah, you ever see the way time flies?) Let me, let me get some money
(Try to catch it) Let me get some money
Let me, let me get some money


Brand Name

[Intro]
*Alarm clock sounds*
Um, uh
Woo, yeah
Woo, yeah
Okay, okay, yeah, um

[Verse 1]
We in-between heaven and hell (Hell)
Fuck a nine-to-five, I'd rather end up dead or in jail (Jail)
American Ninja to these obstacles, no stoppin' me, we on the move
Your mouth runnin' like a prostitute's, keep your head to yourself
I work harder than anybody you know (Know)
I'm done with tricks, don't need no money to blow
Deadly aim, self-contained, superstar, they yell the name
Blood diamonds, finna go to hell for my chain
The P fitted on my head though
I'm too high, you can't reach me with the cell phone
No goodbyes, no hellos
You don't want this life I live, you'd rather had a wife and kid
Shootin' dice with Jesus Christ, put 20 on the midnight
To everyone who sell me drugs:
Don't mix it with that bullshit, I'm hopin' not to join the 27 Club
Just want the coke-dealer house with the velvet rug
Fuck the world, there's no one else but us (Whoa)

[Chorus]
Everything we think we love
It ain't nothin' but a brand name
To everyone but us (Every motherfucker but us)
It ain't nothin' but a brand name, nothin' but a brand name
Yeah
Ask her what she wearin', say it's nothin' but a brand name
Baby, this right here is handmade

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I got brothers, I don't need no friends (Friends)
My shoes off, I'm comfortable, I'm chillin', smokin' weed again (Again)
I'm from the 'Burgh, not the burbs
Investigatin' my nation, homie, we ain't concerned
Went from the 412 out to the 310
Went from the pavement in my basement to them yellow brick roads
See, I was on my P's and Q's like L-M-N-O
But kickin' bitches out my crib, somebody tell 'em go home, oh, no
I was in the crib with my different shit
Simple livin', I'm a hypocrite 'cause I'm filthy rich and got businesses
Been had wifey, had mistresses
Been tryna tell you what my vision is, but y'all still ain't listenin'
The war ain't winnin', it's just beginnin'
And I've been 'bout Sparta like Michigan, I got stats
They got opinions, I got facts
LeBron left home, but he came back
This what raised me, made me rap
PA's baby, I ain't been to PA lately
See, I left and they call me shady
I'm a white rapper, they always call me Shady
Got no idea what I'm contemplatin', I guess (Woo)

[Chorus]
Everything we think we love
It ain't nothin' but a brand name
To everyone but us (Every motherfucker but us)
It ain't nothin' but a brand name, nothin' but a brand name
Yeah
Ask her what she wearin', say it's nothin' but a brand name
Baby, this right here is handmade
Woo

[Outro]
La, la, la, la (La, la, la, la)
Yeah (La, la, la, la)
Everything we love, love
Good mornin' (La, la, la, la)
Good mornin'
And everyone but us (Every motherfucker but us)
Good mornin' (La, la, la, la)
Good mornin'
Yeah


Time Flies (feat. Lil B)

[Intro: Lil B & Mac Miller]
Time flies, time flies
As we keep livin' and as we keep bein' positive
All we can do is hold onto these memories (Yeah)
Mac Miller, I love you

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
All of my homies used to get on my case like, "When you 'bout to kill 'em?"
Soon as I'm out of millions and my girl sprout some children
But I've been murderin' the game, I'm almost out of victims
This food for thought usually enough to feed a thousand pigeons
I'm out here livin' if you wonder where I been though
Shit bro, would you give it all up for these nymphos?
I been broke then got rich, what's inside your wallet?
Half-man and half-amazin', but that's just me bein' modest
I'm an honest man
My mama told me never put it on the lotto and
I work for everything I get, that is my motto, fam
So when I die, these bitches still can fuck my hologram, goddamn

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that...

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Lil B]
(Time flies)
Watch as time go
(Time flies)
Time moves, time flows
(Try to catch it, time flies)
How do we handle these things?
(Time flies, try to catch it)
I am time, we are time and we have control
One thing we need to remember
Is that we are all in this together

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah
You can't expect the unexpected, these dreams I manifested
From my head into reality, they seem a bit excessive, but
I don't stress it, two hands to count my blessings
All the times that I've been reckless with a ego big as Texas
Thinkin', "I'm the man"
I never let these hoes inside the plan
My room for bullshit in the crib small as a child's hands
I fill the shoes and walk the path where only giants stand
I am the fire man, shit, I'm way too fly to land, yeah
I'm smokin' weed all alone
On the road, even though I know they need me at home
Keep my control
From a city where it's freezin' and cold
Each to their own
Punches like this prolly beat up Stallone

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride (Yeah)
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that...

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Lil B]
(Time flies)
One day, we will
(Time flies)
We will find
(Try to catch it, time flies)
We will conquer, conquer with love
(Time flies, try to catch it)
While time is on our side
Continue to hold to those beautiful memories
They won't be here forever, but our spirit lives on
Lil B
