So It Goes

[Intro]
*Dog barking*
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, um
(What?) Yeah
('Sup?) Well

[Chorus 1]
You could have the world in the palm of your hands
You still might drop it
And everybody wanna reach inside your pockets
I tell 'em, "Red light, stop it"
Shit, that give me more headaches than alcoholics

[Verse 1]
There was nothin' in my wallet, just a lot of dreamin'
I built a crib on top o' the Promised Land, we'll call it even
Hmm, I bring more flavor than all the seasons
Winter, spring, summer, fall
The grass is always greener 'til I cut it all
Please leave me to my studies, I give you no applause
My hands been countin' money, and it's hard to be the boss
But somebody gotta do it (It gets so exhausting)
Often with the bullshit, and, baby, I been through it
Enough for the both of us
So come over later and we won't let no one close to us
We could be posted up
Yeah

[Chorus 1]
Okay, well, you could have the world in the palm of your hands
You still might drop it
And everybody wanna reach inside your pockets
So it goes
It's like, in every conversation, we the topic
This narcissism, more like narcotics
So it goes

[Chorus 2]
Well, everybody gather round
I'm still standin', sit down
Whoa-oh
And I know I been out (And I know I been out)
But now I'm back in town (But now I'm back in town), so I
Show you the ropes
So it goes, so it goes, so it goes
La-da-da-da, da-da-da
La-da-da-da, da-da-da
So it goes (Ya!) (So it goes)
La-da-da-da, da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da, da-da-da
So it goes

[Verse 2]
Well, this is a special delivery, comin' to you live with the
Endless artillery, always down to ride
My eyes on the enterprise
Nine lives, never die, fuck a Heaven, I'm still gettin' high
Never mind, did I mention I'm fine?
'Cause her pussy gettin' wetter when the weather dry
Clementine, peelin' off and everyone get left behind
I'm only 5'7'' 'cept I'm feelin' like I'm 7'5"
Damn it, cross planets, interstellar
Never land, not a Jackson, packed with action
So what's happenin', my man?
No relaxin', kickin' back, this ain't exactly in the plan
I can't get no satisfaction, goddamn
They sayin' I been gone too long
I could just tell 'em, "Fuck you," but that come on too strong
My God, it go on and on
Just like a circle, I go back where I'm from

[Chorus 2]
Well, everybody gather round
I'm still standin', sit down
Whoa-oh
And I know I been out (And I know I been out)
But now I'm back in town (But now I'm back in town), so I
Show you the ropes
So it goes, so it goes, so it goes
La-da-da-da, da-da-da
La-da-da-da, da-da-da
So it goes (Ya!) (So it goes)
La-da-da-da, da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da, da-da-da
So it goes

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Yeah, used to wanna be a superhero
Flyin' round with a cape catchin' bad guys
Now my head underwater
But I ain't in the shower and I ain't gettin' baptized (No)
To the good and the bad times (Bad times)
All the cuts, broken bones, and the black eyes (Black eyes)
Young motherfucker with a mad mind
Made a couple million off of rap lines
Y'all can’t tell me nuttin' no more
Came from the basement under that floor (Floor)
You don't come close, you don't even know I'm the G.O.A.T
You don’t need to know how I go
'Cause I know what you want
All I wanna do is the most
Backflip off the rope, sky hook when I'm in the post
Yeah, my girl too clutch to choke (Hmm)
And I ain't callin' it quits
You can build a wall with your bricks
While I keep talkin' that shit, it's like this (It's like this) (Hmm)
Liquor still in my cup (My cup)
Get faded when I wake up (Wake up)
'Cause everything is too much (Too much)
So what? (So what?)

[Pre-Chorus]
Woke up this mornin' with a bright idea (Smoke)
Maybe I can exist forever right here (Let it run)
Yeah (Mmm-hmm, yeah)
Hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm, hmm

[Chorus]
Okay, okay
Well, I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
Well, I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel

[Verse 2]
Hundred-twenty on a car that I don't whip (Woo)
I don't even pull it up the driveway
Throwin' up shots like I don't miss (No)
Never put a limit on the high stakes (No)
Try to pull my card, tell them, "Go Fish" (Woo)
You ain't gonna find a lie in my face
I pick it up and let it go quick
They wanna get pussy from my—(Uh-oh)
Yeah, I don't say nuttin' that I don't know
Jumpin' out the womb wearin' Polo
Everybody wanna jump in, but I'm old school
Lone wolf, take 'em on solo, yeah
I don't need nobody (I don't need nobody!)
I don't need to be nobody (I don't need to be nobody!)
I'm just doin' my thing
Kick it at the crib, I don't see nobody, no
So over there with that bullshit
We don't need it on this side (This side)
I'm pullin' up in that new shit
You always whippin' that dick ride (Dick ride)
I demand your respect
I won't share my connect (No)
Let's get this clear, I am here
I don't care who got next, young vet (Goddamn)
Feelin' like they forget, I let it slide, this time
Like 25 years I've been high and no less (Yes)
Shit, I know, I don't guess
Rather glow, I won't stress
Better say that shit with your chest

[Chorus]
Okay, okay
Well, I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel (Jet fuel)
Well, I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel (Jet fuel)

[Part II: Now Is Only Now]

Fate in your hands
While you're waitin' for me
I'm already there
Fallin' in deep
Now is only now
Head back to the ground, dear


What's the Use?

[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothing without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's somethin' about it
That just freaks me out
I just want another minute with it, fuck a little
What's the use?
Never superficial, you gon' know it when it hit you
Get a little sentimental when I'm off the juice

[Verse 1]
Yeah, okay we're colder than the breeze
But the breeze ain't flowin' like me, motherfucker hol' up
You don't need to hol' up, yeah
And I can show you how I seem
What it is, what it truly might be, nothin' that you know of
You don't need to hol' up
I'm so a-bove and beyond
You take drugs to make it up way up where we on
Space shuttle, Elon
Time, we don't waste much, fuck when we wake up
Then I have her sing just like Céline Dion
Catch me if you can but, you'll never catch me, damn
Whole lotta "yes I am"
All the way in wit' no exit plan
Already left and the jet don't land
Yeah, the time is tickin', come take a ride, get inside
This is highly different, I'm talkin' fly, got a pilot wit' 'im, uh
Can I mind my business?
Why you trippin'? Give you somethin' that your eyes can witness
Ooh, you're too close
I don't understand why you doin' the most

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Snoop Dogg]
You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothin' without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's something about it
That just freaks me out
I just (I just) want (Want a) another ('Nother) minute (Minute) wit' it
Fuck a little, what's the use?
What's the use? Use?
Never (Never) super- (Super) -ficial (Ficial)
You gon' (You gon')  know it (Know it) when it (When it) hit you (Hit you)
Get a (Get a) little (Little) senti- (Senti) -mental when I'm off the juice (Turn it up)

[Verse 2]
Well I'ma give you what you came for, yeah
Shit, I've worked too hard to have a clue who you are
Set the bar so far above par, we can parlay all day
Crib long range with the yard
I know I should probably pray more but you gotta love me
'Cause I save the day spendin' money
When I had nothin', shit it wasn't so funny
Made a promise to the homies nobody go hungry
Look how far we came, still they throwin' dirt on my name
But it never worry my brain
Heads turnin' like a hurricane swervin'
Tell the sun, "Get up outta my shade"
If they don't get the picture, cut 'em out of that frame, shit
I'm up 30 thou' miles plus change
It's been a while but I'm down 'till I'm out and it is what it is 'til it ain't, yeah

[Bridge: Thundercat]
Ooh oooh
Ooh, I just wanna fly

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Snoop Dogg]
You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothin' without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's something about it
That just freaks me out
I just (I just) want (Want a) another ('Nother) minute (Minute) wit' it
Fuck a little, what's the use?
What's the use? Use?
Never (Never) super- (Super) -ficial (Ficial)
You gon' (You gon')  know it (Know it) when it (When it) hit you (Hit you)
Get a (Get a) little (Little) senti- (Senti) -mental when I'm off the juice (Juice)

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
You can love it
It just freaks me out


Ladders

[Chorus (Extended)]
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it take
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day
Can't stop, then you won't stop
I know just how that feel
When you're on top, 'til the ball drop
You've never seen it be so real
It feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day

[Verse 1]
Feel it a little, feel it a lot
I'm swimmin' a bit, but deeper in thought
Keepin' my head on top of my shoulders
Into some shit, I'm out of the box
This the level I'm on
Needin' it all right now, when forever is gone
Baby, the weather is strong
Whether it's hot or cold
I'm comin', knockin' on yo' door
Well, I'ma, I'ma maintain how I'm stayin' so high
Put the ladder all the way up 'til we touchin' the sky
And you know you're dead wrong, you're in love with a lie
All I, all I, all I wanna do is free yo' mind
We don't see no lines, we don't color inside
It's a very small world, we don't fuck with the size
Yeah, see the bigger picture when it's beneficial
Lovin' how I catch you
Blow the whistle when you run out of time
Yeah, wakin' up, I open up my eyes
Do you mind if I blow yo' mind?
A little closer, baby, don't be shy
Why you worried that it's gon' be fine?
I guess it's that kinda day
It's really all I'm tryna say
We don't have a lot of time to waste
Somehow we gotta find a way

[Chorus]
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day

[Post-Chorus]
I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot yo' shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
All the- lights flickerin', hittin' the right switches
I'm livin' this life different and missin' the flight bullshittin'
I had a plan to change, you can't stand the rain
Little delayed, but I came and you cool wit' it
I don't trip, flip or lose my grip
And I don't know it all, but I do know this
Before you know me, better know self
I've been in this shit so long that it don't smell
I turn the hotel to a castle
Livin' like a king for a grand
I don't do nothin', that's a hassle
Besides, even that castle made of sand
Just might slip into the sea
Fuck it all, if it all ain't me
Maybe we inside the maze
Somehow we gotta find a way, okay

[Chorus]
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day

[Post-Chorus]
I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot yo' shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got

[Instrumental Outro]


2009

[Intro]
Yeah
Eric
Well

[Chorus]
I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

[Verse 1]
Yeah, okay, you gotta jump in to swim
Well, the light was dim in this life of sin
Now every day I wake up and breathe
I don't have it all but that's all right with me
Take it nice and easy, took a flight to see me
Send you back home with a light that's beamin'
The whole team 'bout to figure it out
We ice cold, that's what winter about
And sometimes, sometimes I wish I took a simpler route
Instead of havin' demons that's as big as my house, mhmm
Have a ball with a dribble and bounce
'Cause the party ain't over 'til they're kickin' me out, yeah
Isn't it funny? We can make a lot of money
Buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly
I was yea high and muddy
Lookin' for what was lookin' for me

[Chorus]
But I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they ask me what I'm smilin' for
Well, because I've never been this high before
It's like I never felt alive before
Mhmm, I'd rather have me peace of mind than war
See, me and you, we ain't that different
I struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'
Take my time to finish, mind my business
A life ain't a life 'til you live it, I was diggin' me a hole
Big enough to bury my soul
Weight of the world, I gotta carry my own
My own, with these arms I can carry you home
I'm right here when you scared and alone, and I ain't never in a hurry
You don't ever gotta worry
Even when it's 7:30 and the time is runnin' low
When your heart get cold
See what's behind all them unturned stones
And I'm a pro when it come to my job
But really I'm just tryna start believin' in God
Now when it gets hard
I don't panic, I don't sound the alarm

[Chorus]
Because I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door


Come Back to Earth

[Chorus]
My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head

[Verse]
In my own way, this feel like livin'
Some alternate reality
And I was drownin', but now I'm swimmin'
Through stressful waters to relief
Yeah, oh, the things I'd do
To spend a little time in Hell
And what I won't tell you
I'll prolly never even tell myself

[Bridge]
And don't you know that sunshine don't feel right
When you inside all day
I wish it was nice out, but it look like rain
Grey skies are driftin', not livin' forever
They told me it only gets better

[Chorus]
My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head


Hurt Feelings

[Chorus]
I'm always sayin' I won't change but

Everything is different, I can't complain
You don't know what you missin', shame on you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Shame on you (Yeah)
Everything is strange (Strange,) that's just a game (Game)
Everybody trippin' (Woo,) throwin’ it away (Yeah)
We was gettin' lifted, now we gettin' paid
Shame on you (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
A—a'ight, a'ight
I paid the cost to see apostrophes
That means it's mine (Yeah,) keep to myself, takin' my time (Uh-huh)
Always into some bullshit, and outta line
Drivin' with my eyes closed, missin' all the signs
Turn the ignition, I'm driven and sittin' pretty (Pretty)
Listenin' to Whitney and whippin' it through the city, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Man on a mission, figure it out
Puttin' way too much on my shoulders, please hold me down (Down, down)
I keep my head above the water (Water)
My eyes gettin' bigger, so the world is gettin' smaller (Smaller)
I be gettin' richer but that only made me crazy
Mama told me I was different even when I was a baby
That Mercedes through the P.A. when I pull up (Pull up), soundin' like a concert
Or a (or a) monster truck, I'm trippin' but I'm fallin' up
Always said I want it all, but it's not enough
Well, o-kay (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same (Same)
Everything is different, I can't complain

And everything is strange (Strange,) that's just a game (Game)
Everybody trippin' (Woo,) throwin’ it away (Yeah)

Shame on you (Yeah)

[Bridge]
We only just begun
No, we don't wanna hurt your feelings
'Cause it’s only just begun
No, we don't wanna
Hurt (Hurt) feelings (Feelings)

[Verse 2]
Down go the system, long live the king (King)
Turn the power off and get your water from the spring (Spring)
I'm bringing everyone with me when shit get iffy (Yeah)
I give a hundred and fifty percent
This is the shit that I'm dealing with, but I wish I'd forget
Used to be feelin' depressed, now that I'm livin' I'm a little obsessed, yes
High in Jacuzzis, I be hittin' the jets
I'm showing her some love she been givin' me sex (Bless, bless)
Respect to Adonai
Don't fuck around and be a victim of your pride, why you lyin'?
(Why you lyin'?) Tell the truth, just step aside
I don't got the time to let it slide (Yep)
I'm too grounded, push whips that move mountains
New cribs, blue fountains, these are my surroundings
I've been going through it, you just go around it
But it's really not that different when you think about it

[Chorus]
I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same (Same)
Everything is different, I can't complain
You don't know what you missin', shame on you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Shame on you (Yeah)
And everything is strange (Strange,) that's just a game (Game)
Everybody trippin' (Woo,) throwin’ it away (Yeah)
We was gettin' lifted, now we gettin' paid
Shame on you (Yeah)

Hurt
Feelings


Wings

[Intro]
Yeah
Well

[Verse 1]
I got a bone to pick like roses (Roses)
I ain't feelin' broken no more
Balled a fist, they gossipin', I notice
Talkin' shit, I wander through the motives
Wonder who the fuck we're supposed to be
I ain't worried now 'til I leave
I'm just tryna ride and feel the breeze
With somethin' bad beside n' next to me
Wind in my face, don't stop now when it feels so great
You can run 'til you slip on the sidewalk
And the same bone that you picked gon' break, that's a motif (That's a motif)
Yeah, when it's comin' right back, so familiar, never been realer
Never felt so damn good where I'm at
I don't know what it's all about
Runnin' through too many thoughts to count (That's way better)
Still ain't addin' up, I'll let you know when I've had enough, yeah
Yeah, well

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd put some money on forever, but I (Hey)
Don't like to gamble on the weather, so I
Just watch while
The sun is shinin', I can look at the horizon
The walls keep gettin' wider, I just hope I never find 'em, I know
Hey, well

[Chorus]
These are my wings, these are my wings, yeah
These are my wings, yeah, well

[Verse 2]
Movin' so fast, the clock look slow (Slow)
Water my seeds 'til the flower just grow, yeah
Love so much that my heart get broke
I don't really know how the normal shit go, so
I guess I just play it by ear, silence is all that I hear
Listenin' close as I can
Growin' up (One, two, three), jump
Nobody holdin' my hand, no
Trust is a problem, never knew how
Yeah, that's why I just keep to myself
Get what I need, then I'll be out (Please tell me)
Who can surf the universe with me?
Lucifer is human, so are we
All I ever want is what I need
And that don't include your time and company
Follow me, we on the up and up
Remember when I owed a hundred bucks?
Now, I look around like, "What the fuck?"
If you don't fuck with me, you fuckin' up

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I need to watch my temper, so I
Don't ever gamble on the weather, but I
Just watch while the
The sun is shinin', I can look at the horizon
The walls keep gettin' wider, I just hope I never find 'em, no, no
Yeah, well

[Chorus]
These are my wings, these are my wings
These are my wings


Conversation Pt. 1

[Chorus]
We ain't on the same shit, no way
You ain't from my planet, we don't speak the same language
This is an occasion, ain't it?
I'm feelin' good and they hate it
Shit, I don't recognize these faces
Yeah, where you from, who you came with?
Started in the basement
Made it way above the top, now I'm in the spaceship
In a spaceship, shit is spacious

[Verse 1]
Swear your life is basic
All you do is sit around the house, you gettin' faded
That ain't entertainment, yeah
You missin' every single shot that you ain't takin'
Hey kid, you can use a little bit of your imagination
It can do you right, improve a life you busy wastin'
Said it's your money if you make it
Otherwise, it's just a conversation

[Bridge 1]
Okay, why you always hatin'?
Lacin' up my sneakers, I be runnin' out of patience
Yeah, it ain't your money 'til you make it
Otherwise, it's just a conversation

[Chorus]
We ain't on the same shit, no way
You ain't from my planet, we don't speak the same language
This is an occasion, ain't it?
I'm feelin' good and they hate it
Shit, I don't recognize these faces
Yeah, where you from, who you came with?
Started in the basement
Made it way above the top, now I'm in the spaceship
In the spaceship, shit is spacious

[Verse 2]
Everybody famous, everybody wild, everybody dangerous
Get a couple dollars, now they act as strangers
Now they wanna give a couple statements
When you really 'bout it, you don't say shit
Pocket full of aces
Take over my city, yeah, that's really home invasions
All my homies wit' me, gettin' busy, no vacations
They ain't on my wave but they wavin’
Stop it, boy, you runnin' through your savings

[Bridge 2]
Yeah, I just feel amazin'
My head up in the clouds but my feet be on the pavement
Yeah, it ain't your money 'til you make it
Otherwise, it's just a conversation

[Chorus]
We ain't on the same shit, no way
You ain't from my planet, we don't speak the same language
This is an occasion, ain't it?
I'm feelin' good and they hate it
Shit, I don't recognize these faces
Yeah, where you from, who you came with?
Started in the basement
Made it way above the top, now I'm in the spaceship
In the spaceship, shit is spacious


Self Care

[Part I: Self Care]

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Mhm, mhm
Okay
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Dollars

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I switched the time zone, but what do I know?
Spendin' nights hitchhikin', where will I go?
I could fly home, with my eyes closed
But it'd get kinda hard to see, that's no surprise though
And you could find me, I ain't hidin'
I don't move my feet when I be glidin'
I just slide in and then I roll
Out

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & JID]
Yep
Well, climbing over that wall (Yeah, wall, wall,) mm
I remember, yes, I remember, yes, I remember it all
Swear the height be too tall (Yeah), so like September I fall
(Down, down, down) Down below, now I know that the medicine be on call, yeah (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme)
It's feelin' like you hot enough to melt, yeah (Melt, yeah)
Can't trust no one, can't even trust yourself, yeah (-Self, yeah)
And I love you, I don't love nobody else, yeah (Else, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller & JID]
Tell them they can take that bullshit elsewhere (Yeah)
Self care, I'm treatin' me
Right, yeah
Hell yeah
We gonna be alright (We gon' be alright)

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I switched the time zone (Yeah), but what do I know? (Yeah)
Spendin' nights hitchhikin', where will I go?
I could fly home (Yeah), with my eyes closed (Yeah)
But it'd get kinda hard to see, that's no surprise though
And you could find me (Yeah), I ain't hidin' (Yeah)
I don't move my feet when I be gliding
I just slide in (Yeah) and then I roll
Out

[Interlude: Devonté Hynes]
Been on the road
I don't see it
Out on the road
I don't see where I'm going

[Verse 2: Mac Miller & JID]
Yeah, I been reading them signs (Wow, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I been losin' my, I been losin' my, I been losin' my mind, yeah (Yeah)
Get the fuck out the way ('Kay), must be this high to play (Okay)
It must be nice up above the lights and what a lovely life that I made, yeah (Uh)
I know that feelin' like it's in my family tree, yeah (Whoa)
That Mercedes drove me crazy, I was speedin'
Somebody save me from myself, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Tell them they can take that bullshit elsewhere
Self care, we gonna be
Good
Hell yeah
They lettin' me go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I switched the time zone (Yeah), but what do I know? (Yeah)
Spendin' nights hitchhikin', where will I go? (Yeah)
I could fly home (Yeah) with my eyes closed (Yeah)
But it'd get kinda hard to see, that's no surprise though (Yeah)
And you could find me (Yeah), I ain't hidin' (Yeah)
I don't move my feet when I be glidin' (Yeah)
I just slide in (Yeah) and then I roll
Out

[Part II: Oblivion]

[Intro: Mac Miller]
I didn't know, I didn't know
I didn't know, I didn't know
Yeah, well
Didn't know what I was missing, now I see a lil' different
I was, thinking too much, got stuck in oblivion
Yeah, yeah, oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah
I got all the time in the world, so for now I'm just chilling
Plus I know it's a, it's a beautiful feeling
In oblivion, yeah, yeah, oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah

[Verse: Mac Miller]
Yeah, okay I ride around my city when I come home, yeah
The sun set quickly then get up slow, yeah
I disconnect and upload
Watch it spin around, we just spin it round, yeah
Let's go and travel through the unknown, yeah
We play it cool, we know we fucked though, yeah
You keep on sayin' you in love so
Tell me are you really down? Are you really down? Yeah
Let's go back to my crib and play some 45's
It's safer there, I know there's still a war outside
We spend our nights all liquored up, our mornings high
Can you feel it now?

[Outro: Mac Miller]
Oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah, oohhh
I got
All the time in the world, so for now I'm just chilling
Plus, I know it's a, it's a beautiful feeling
In oblivion, yeah, yeah, oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah


Perfecto

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Well, it ain't perfect but I don't mind
Because it's worth it
Who really has the time at all?
It ain't perfect but I don't mind
'Cause on the surface I look so fine
But really I'm buggin', buggin'
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'

[Verse 1]
Yeah, as hard as it gets: cool, calm and collected
Holdin' my breath, this ain't what I expected
Don't argue to death, pull my heart out my chest
The cards is all on the table, I'm callin' it
Don't say it, I swallow it
When livin' off of borrowed time
Often I'm on the fence, on a line
Addin' up what's on my mind
My feet on the clouds, head on the ground
That we goin' down, bet you know me now

[Bridge 1]
I'm treadin' water, I swear
That if I drown, I don't care
They callin' for me from the shore, I need more

[Chorus]
Well, it ain't perfect but I don't mind
Because it's worth it
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is It?)
Who really has the time at all?
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is It?)
It ain't perfect but I don't mind
'Cause on the surface I look so fine
But really I'm buggin', buggin'
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it feel like the weekend on a Tuesday, I can move dates
"I got somethin' else to do" day, always do hate
If I do say, the D'USSÉ with the homies like it's Kool-Aid
Me? I'm just tryna play it cool, J (Anyways)
Yeah, mind over matter, I'm purer than alkaline
Been stuck on album time, I gotta get out to shine
Fly on the wall, shit, I was buggin'
Miss me like you gettin' withdrawal, I keep that comin', yeah

[Bridge 2]
I'm treadin' water, I know
If I stop movin', I'll float
They nothin' new, it—
Just play it cool, baby, just play it cool
You know, cool

[Chorus]
Well, it ain't perfect but I don't mind
Because it's worth it
Who really has the time at all?
It ain't perfect but I don't mind
'Cause on the surface I look so fine
But really I'm buggin', buggin'
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'

[Outro]
Yeah, tell me you love me, spin me around
Pretty please, pick me up in the air and don't put me down
Seen it all unfold, sat back and watched
Knowin' time don't give a fuck about clocks until they stop
Bare feet, runnin' late, her car started
Even though the only thing that she drivin' a hard bargain
More important is I'm kinda sorta out the door but
She put me back together when I'm out of order
Perfect


Dunno

[Intro]
Yeah
Hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm
Yeah

[Verse 1]
She do whatever she like
And that just don't seem right, yeah
Make people so mad, yeah
And they want her so bad, hm, well
We was fuckin', almost missed my flight
I wasn't even trippin', I said, "It's alright," yeah
Goddamn, we was hit last night
Wouldn't you rather get along?
Wouldn't you rather get along?
You was coughin' when you hit my weed
But I've never seen you feel that free
So cute, you wanna be like me
Wouldn't you rather get along?
Wouldn't you rather get along?

[Chorus]
Until, until there is no longer
Let's get lost inside the cloud
And you, you don't gotta work harder
I can calm you down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, well, I was busy when you hit my phone
But you miss me, told me come back home, yeah
And you don't really like to sleep alone
But I'm takin' too long, I'm always takin' too long
Baby, we don't need a trip, we could be right here
When the shit get weird, we could switch up gears
I wanna see them lips, kissin' ear to ear
I wanna hear your song
Oh, I wanna feel just how you feel
Touch you one more time so I know you're real
We could spin that wheel, wouldn't you rather get along?

[Chorus]
Until, until there is no longer
Let's get lost inside the cloud
And you, you don't gotta work harder
I can calm you down

[Outro]
I think we just might be alright, thank God
I think we're gonna be alright, alright, okay
Hold me close, don't hold your breath
This feelin' your favorite, I know
